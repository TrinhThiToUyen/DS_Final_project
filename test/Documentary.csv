AmeriCaN_TeRRoRiST,0,"A new film by Joseph D. Bonczyk. This endeavor addresses the continuing disaster that is the modern school shooter/bomber era, which commenced on April 20, 1999 in Littleton, Colorado. After planning for more than a year, two teenagers drove from their comfortable suburban homes toting more than 90 homemade bombs and a cache of firearms to school intending to blow Columbine High off the face of the planet, killing hundreds of their classmates and teachers in the process. At 11:19 a.m on April 20, 1999. when the two large bombs they had planted in the Columbine HIgh School cafeteria failed to detonate, the 17 and 18 year old killers moved into active shooter mode, murdering 13 people in cold blood. They also wounded more than 20 others, and then committed suicide in the school library where most of the carnage had occurred. Columbine has been the blueprint for countless other mass shootings that have occurred through the years as perpetrated by American teenagers and early 20-somethings, each one more shocking than the last. Copycats known as ""Columbinites"" have popped up in other parts of the world as well, including in Crimea the Ukrane when on October 17, 2018 an 18-year-old student shot 20 people to death and wounded 70 more before committing suicide, just like his heroes, in the school library.

J.E.S.U.S.A.,93,"J.E.S.U.S.A. is an in-depth exploration of the relationship between Christianity and American nationalism and the violence that often emerges from it. Far from a new phenomenon, this documentary traces the co-opting of Christianity by the state all the way back to the age of Constantine, when the Christian faith became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Through interviews with a diverse group of scholars, pastors, historians, and activists, this film shows how specific readings of the Bible have led many Christians to confuse their devotion to Jesus with their dedication to the state. The film helps viewers rediscover and restore long-held Christian beliefs regarding nonviolence, inspiring Christians to become purveyors of peace rather than enablers of conflict and violence.",2020,Documentary            ,"Diana Butler Bass, Gregory A.

Divine Instinct,0,"Gary Spinosa stepped away from his growing reputation among the handful of rising sculptors in the world, choosing instead to study and follow his artistic vision on a 28-acre farm in Venango, Pennsylvania. For thirty years, he's lived a reclusive life working seven days a week on his art, passing through phases of Mummies, Portals, Icons and hand-sized ceramic pieces he calls Stones. His work transcends our modern pathological consumption as well as the consumer art that defines our society. We step into his world of dreams, transformed by a spiritual consciousness that skirts, or perhaps more accurately blends, Christianity with ancient gods and Paganism, and Reality with the Metaphysical. Spinosa's work transfixes the viewer like the Sirens of Ancient Greek mythology, but Spinosa isn't luring you to a shipwreck. He guides you on a journey into the psyche, both ancient and fresh in an Archaic Revival. The documentary walks you along Spinosa's past, by his canary-yellow Ford Pinto rusting back into the earth, to his heart-wrenching inability to create for years, to a redemptive art and life that soothes with its gentleness and challenges with its audacity. The Spinosa Project will make you ache for something better for your own living soul and reminds us that Art may be humanities' truest legacy.",2020,Documentary            ,James Gossard,,0,,0.0
