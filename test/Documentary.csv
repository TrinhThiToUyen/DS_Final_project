Amazing Grace,55,"Grace Fisher was a child prodigy musician, proficient on 3 instruments, and on her way to the world famous Berklee College of Music in Boston. At her 17th birthday party, with her friends present, she developed a severe pain in her spine. By the time she got to the hospital, 5 minutes away, she could not walk. By that night, she could not breathe. Grace Fisher was diagnosed as patient 101 with Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM), a rare polio-like disease, with no cure and no clear understanding of why this mysterious illness has ravaged the bodies of over 500 children in the US, most of them under the age of 7. AFM strikes every other year. 2020 is expected to be the worst year yet. If this had happened 50 years ago, Gracie would be living in an iron lung, but due to medical progress and the astounding strength and perseverance of this brilliant musician, Grace is able to live a rewarding life as a composer of sublime musical scores for full orchestras, presented to sold out audiences. Academy Award winning composer of La La Land, Justin Hurwitz, says, ""Gracie is one of the most inspiring people I've ever met."" He compares her symphony, Waltz of the Waves, to the scores of Nino Rota, Academy Award winning composer of The Godfather. Gracie says it best, ""My only limitation will be my imagination."" This 55 minute documentary follows Grace Fisher on her journey from ""quadriplegic floating head"" to triumphant composer relishing a thunderous ovation in the concert hall. With limitations come powers, and in Gracie's case, the power to create sublime harmonic beauty.",2020,Documentary            ,"Grace Fisher, Justin Hurwitz, Chris Fossek, Earl Stewart",Lynn Montgomery,0,

Balloon Man,100,"The rubber met the road in the early 1970s for Bill Costen. After being drafted by the Buffalo Bills and later being sent to a Buffalo farm team in Hartford, CT, a life-threatening tragedy forced him to put the pads down. The result was a lark that led to the birth of the first African American hot-air balloon master pilot in the country. Balloon Man is about more than a 6'5 ex-jock showing the world how to navigate through the clouds; who weathered the ordeal of his mom passing when he was only 10 years old; who flunked out the University of Nebraska his freshman year and moved across the country with something to prove; who warmed the bench in high school only to be drafted in the pros five years later; who survived numerous twists and turns in his life to avoid becoming another ignominious statistic. It is about flight in every sense of the word. Told through the eyes of Bill's award-winning filmmaker daughter, Chantal Potter, Balloon Man is a multi-layered film that displays a story untold, that will prompt a call to your nearest hot air balloon pilot right after it makes you contemplate the meaning of a dream deferred. It is a piece of history that serves as another reminder of the rich tapestry of not only the African American stock, but also humanity.

Each episode Danielle drives down America's roads-less-traveled - from the outback of Montana's forgotten two-lane highways to Route 66 - being directed by her angels to people in out-of-the-way places who are in need of angelic guidance, giving viewers an angel's-eye view of the human condition in a country divided. Along the way, Danielle often receives a heavenly ""heads up"" to pull over and investigate eerie localities known for unexplained apparitions, or unidentified flying objects - leaving her to figure out these mysteries in order to free those who are in the grip of fear. Wherever she finds herself - sharing life-changing angel messages in a disaster zone, over a simple slice of pie at a diner, assisting law enforcement in devastating cold cases, solving pressing paranormal mysteries, or just hanging in a bar with her guitar - Danielle dishes up her unique brand of divine TLC. Where human pain meets the angels' perspective of human possibility, the transformations speak for themselves.

Felix Savon: For Love of The Cuban Son,90,"Felix Savon (Fabre) won an unprecedented six world amateur championships, three Pan-American games titles, as well as three Olympic gold medals but never turned profession. Coming from communist Cuba, Savon became a symbol of Fidel Castro's politically defiant might. Over 12 years and three Olympic games Savon reportedly turned down an estimated 37 million dollars to leave the amateur ranks and follow in the footsteps of fellow countryman Joel Casamayor. The question is, why would Felix Savon turn down fame and fortune for doing what he clearly proved he was the best at? This is the question at the root of this story and perhaps many of the now slanderous rumors saturating Cuba about Savon's reasoning, was it loyalty, fear, or something else entirely? Having cultivated a close relationship with Cuba's popular leader Fidel Castro, perhaps Savon's loyalty would not allow him to betray his friend and President. Now nearly 20 years have past since his last Olympic championship and Savon is ready to set the record straight as he deals with tumultuous rumors of abuse, as well as economic hardships. Now as he is second guessing his decision to stay in Cuba, the great Felix Savon will answer the 37 million dollar question by showing us the country he loves through his own eyes.

After planning for more than a year, two teenagers drove from their comfortable suburban homes toting more than 90 homemade bombs and a cache of firearms to school intending to blow Columbine High off the face of the planet, killing hundreds of their classmates and teachers in the process. At 11:19 a.m on April 20, 1999. when the two large bombs they had planted in the Columbine HIgh School cafeteria failed to detonate, the 17 and 18 year old killers moved into active shooter mode, murdering 13 people in cold blood. They also wounded more than 20 others, and then committed suicide in the school library where most of the carnage had occurred. Columbine has been the blueprint for countless other mass shootings that have occurred through the years as perpetrated by American teenagers and early 20-somethings, each one more shocking than the last. Copycats known as ""Columbinites"" have popped up in other parts of the world as well, including in Crimea the Ukrane when on October 17, 2018 an 18-year-old student shot 20 people to death and wounded 70 more before committing suicide, just like his heroes, in the school library.

The titles were intriguing: ""He saved 8,000 Jews"", ""Polish Schindler"" - and encouraged the artists to query Lazowski and Matulewicz, whose history seemed to have been forgotten. Who were they and how did they save so many people? Starting from this information, we learn chronologically the history of Eugeniusz Lazowski. As in a police investigation, we try to discover the truth by visiting places and people with whom Lazowski was associated. This is a film about a brave and heroic man in the dark times of war. It is also a film about history and our ideas about it; about journalistic reliability and unreliability, for which fake news and all half-truths are the breeding ground.

Divine Instinct,0,"Gary Spinosa stepped away from his growing reputation among the handful of rising sculptors in the world, choosing instead to study and follow his artistic vision on a 28-acre farm in Venango, Pennsylvania. For thirty years, he's lived a reclusive life working seven days a week on his art, passing through phases of Mummies, Portals, Icons and hand-sized ceramic pieces he calls Stones. His work transcends our modern pathological consumption as well as the consumer art that defines our society. We step into his world of dreams, transformed by a spiritual consciousness that skirts, or perhaps more accurately blends, Christianity with ancient gods and Paganism, and Reality with the Metaphysical. Spinosa's work transfixes the viewer like the Sirens of Ancient Greek mythology, but Spinosa isn't luring you to a shipwreck. He guides you on a journey into the psyche, both ancient and fresh in an Archaic Revival. The documentary walks you along Spinosa's past, by his canary-yellow Ford Pinto rusting back into the earth, to his heart-wrenching inability to create for years, to a redemptive art and life that soothes with its gentleness and challenges with its audacity. The Spinosa Project will make you ache for something better for your own living soul and reminds us that Art may be humanities' truest legacy.",2020,Documentary            ,James Gossard,,0,

The Republics,83,"For four decades, poet, translator and activist Stephen Watts has been the quietly urgent, profoundly committed voice of the marginalised and the overlooked, whether person or place. Now he has found his collaborative equal in the engaged 16mm filmmaker Huw Wahl, who has translated the text of Watt's book-length prose poem Republic Of Dogs/Republic Of Birds into a luminous feature-length documentary essay of remarkable beauty and spirited attention. Anchored in Watts' biography and lines, it explores the larger truths of being and the calibrations of response to often hard earned, lived experience. Considering the changing landscapes of settlement in London's East End and Scottish islands, the destruction of working-class culture and an attendant sense of the collective, the film and its writing are themselves forms of cultural activism: elegy, celebration and a toolkit for ongoing resistance. Never rhetorical, always endowed with a profound empathy and a deep sense of relation - to time, place and human struggle - The Republics is one of the most impressive artists' films of recent years, whose own poetry speaks as honestly and eloquently as that of the writer it portrays.",2020,Documentary            ,Stephen Watts,Huw Wahl,0,

This leads to hybridization and a gradual dilution of cutthroat genetics. But the discovery of an isolated population of pure-strain westslope cutthroats is allowing scientists to restore their numbers - one stream section at a time. The film will follow fisheries crews from the expansive Yellowstone Lake to the park's remote streams to the breathtaking Bridger Wilderness - the most isolated region in the continental U.S. and accessible only on foot or by horseback.

Bio,58,"The film intertwines the stories of three characters who mark the lifestyle and geography of the valley. DOWN IN THE VALLEY a thriving pear cultivator, Cao, sprays pesticides to harvest fruit with a perfect shape. In springtime, in the absence of insects, he needs to pollinate all his trees by hand. Zhang, the last beekeeper in the area, escapes UP NORTH, searching for clean spots most of the year. HIGH UP ON THE SLOPES of the valley that still support wildlife, a poor farmer, Ye, bets his last money on an organic cherry orchard. Cao, Zhang and Ye are shown in relation to nature as the seasons change - in an orchard without pollinating insects, among the hives of the last domesticated bees and in a mountainside forest where wild bees still fly. In Bio, the strength of portraying social documentary is paired with the magic of the artistic nature film, Kristersson's trademark. Candid scenes and evocative images will carry the narrative. The life in the beehive and the pupation of butterfly larvae will intertwine with Zhang's tearful parting from her daughter, Ye's happiness at selling his crops to a good price and Cao's plans to pass on the pear cultivation craft to his son. We portray man as a species of nature, a part of the local ecosystem. Cinematic nature photography, authentic human activities, and Kristersson 's unique attention to animal behaviors, will make the viewers experience the tight, but fragile,networks of existence that are put at risk without pollinators.",2021,Documentary            ,"Åsa Ekman, Mikael Kristersson",,0,

Now, by documenting an annual bike ride (Ride for the Living) that re-traces the steps of a young Polish holocaust survivor from Auschwitz to Krakow in 1945, and studying the unlikely relationship that arose between that survivor and a 30-year old cycling enthusiast today, we can begin to reveal how human empathy is both a journey and a weapon of defense. And we explore whether the power of empathy might actually be harnessed to face down the way perpetrators of genocide have marshaled fear, ignorance and bigotry. To convert mere remembrance into empathetic action and extinguish the de-humanization that makes genocide possible.",2020,Documentary            ,Marc Bennett,,0,

With films on Montecassino and Ortona illustrating the effects the Italian campaign had on a civilian population during WWII, specifically along the infamous Gustav Line, a fitting conclusion to this trilogy lies in San Pietro Infine. San Pietro Infine is located just South of the Gustav Line, between Cassino and Ortona. Like many towns, this place was conquered, bombed, its civilians mercilessly tortured, and eventually liberated. After the war, 3000 survivors, left with nothing, immigrated to Canada in an attempt to start over. The ones that remained did not have the heart to rebuild on the ruins of the dead. Instead, they rebuilt the entire town a few hundred meters down the road and named it San Pietro del Lazio. Leaving the ruins of the old town untouched for 75 years. A burial ground to history.

Extinction Rebellion New York City,6,"Extinction Rebellion is an international movement that uses non-violent direct action to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency. Life on Earth is in crisis: scientists agree we have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown. Conventional approaches of voting, lobbying, petitions and protest have failed because powerful political and economic interests prevent change. Our strategy is therefore one of non-violent, disruptive civil disobedience - a rebellion. Video plays an important role in the production and dissemination of the movement's identity and tactics. This film has four parts. Each features a non-violent direct action organized by the New York City chapter of Extinction Rebellion.",2020,"Short, Documentary, Drama            ","Steven Gray, Alexia Oldini",,0,
Pass the Salt,44,"Pass the Salt is an hour-long investigation into the mysteries of one of our most fundamental elements: salt. It's an exploration that takes us from far beneath the earth's crust, to the inner depths of the human body - a search for the real answers to a mounting debate about the benefits and dangers of sodium chloride (table salt). Pass the Salt uses creative and stylish visual analogs to bring this science to life. One would think that our understanding of something as basic as salt (sometimes referred to as ""the fifth element"") would be straightforward, but the humble salt-shaker holds many mysteries. We meet passionate players from both sides of the dinner table and discover how long-held beliefs are being questioned - and how everything we thought we knew about salt may be wrong. We'll taste-test salts from around the world, de-bunk myths, and re-examine data. We'll join scientists and scholars, salt harvesters, chefs and specialists on the front lines of the ""Great Salt Debate"" in labs, kitchens, salt harvesting operations - and even spaceships. This is a fantastic opportunity to explore new science about an ancient substance that's been a part of culture and cuisine from our very beginnings.",2020,"Documentary, Short            ",Michael McNamara,,0,

This film is meant to teach the audience what it means to be transgender, stress their struggles with, but not limited to, health, violence, and political issues. It will also include the support group or families of those who identify as transgender, and show their perspective. I also want to show that being transgender is more of how you feel not how you look. I want to be able to give a platform to those who are trans so that they can share their stories. It is also important to note that the perspective of the support groups in these people's lives will also be documented. The spouses and/or children will be included. Overall, this film will show that people in the transgender community are regular people who live their lives just like everyone else, but have substantially harder struggles than the average person.",2020,"Documentary, Short            ","Mary Bridgland, Candice Sweet, Jennifer Sweet, Kasumi Umakisp",Emma Jean,0,
