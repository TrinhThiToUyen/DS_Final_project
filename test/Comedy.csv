Several years ago, he dumped Mary and her mom during a typical, mid-life meltdown. Now eighteen, Mary has found the perfect way to get back at him - run for Mayor against him! She gives up a lot to do this, not the least of which is passing up the opportunity to attend college along with her friends including her high school sweetheart. Making her decision all the more difficult, Mary was accepted to every university to which she applied. She worked hard for what should be the best years of her life, but instead chooses to stay behind to wage war against her dad...to get even. Mary's mother and grandfather, the local preacher, along with pretty much everyone else in town, know why she's doing this. Even though Mary denies it at first, she's too smart to not see it herself. But her mind is made up and, when she puts her mind to something, she focuses on it and won't let go until it's done. Then something happens; in the middle of the battle with her dad, she discovers that the town actually could use new leadership and some forward thinking. A fresh coat of paint wouldn't hurt either. Once a great summer vacation community, the town has suffered, along with other small American towns in recent years. Small businesses have closed their doors and main Street is disappearing. Mary comes up with some out of the box solutions that ignite and inspire the town. It looks like she might just win....

Basically, something else will get you first.

Barry's stage fright, the ten dollar entry fee, and trauma of being decked by a flying apple last time he sang on stage, are all keeping him from entering. Jody passionately convinces Barry to go for it, but says he's going to need some serious training. Jody trains Barry the best and only way he knows how. The training is not even close to practical. From dodging apples while blindfolded, to a staring contest in a bathtub with mouths full of hot sauce, they truly believe these things are going to get Barry to the next level. On the night of the contest, as fate would have it, it's ""Free Apple Night"" at the bar. After a merciless taunting by his competition, Gene, Barry is called to stage. Jody delivers an impassioned pep-talk for the ages.
