On April 1, 2018, while in the middle of shooting his fortieth feature, Harry is killed in the most preposterous possible way - he's hit by a piece of the Chinese Tiangong 1 space station that did not burn up during re-entry, making him the first person to ever be killed by a piece of space junk. Harry becomes the unwilling donor in a heart transplant operation, the recipient of which is the dreaded Julia Philkins, ""the biggest shark producer in Hollywood"", before finding himself at The Re-Cycling Center, an ethereal netherworld where he awaits his Letters of Transit so he can be re-cycled back to real life. His case worker at the center is Ariel, a vivacious young woman from Fort Lee, New Jersey, who had dreamed of becoming a film actress before her untimely demise in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Harry and Ariel's topsy-turvy May-December romance plays out while Julia creates chaos in Hollywood by morphing into another Harry and abruptly turning away from CGI-driven comic book films to intimate human stories. Julia drags the rest of the industry's copycat producers with her, leaving 5.000 VFx artists out of work and the streets of Hollywood looking like a remake of the last reel of ""The Day of the Locust.""

Basically, something else will get you first. However, given Max's age and otherwise great physical shape, his urologist, Dr. Hap, recommends a radical prostatectomy - surgical removal of the cancerous prostate. Max is torn between Dr. Hap's opinion and the adamant stance championed by his (behind-the-scenes) significant other who protests that surgery would be a drastic mistake.
