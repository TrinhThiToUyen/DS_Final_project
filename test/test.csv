Aulcie,75,"Aulcie tells the inspiring story of Aulcie Perry, a basketball legend who led Maccabi Tel Aviv to an upset win in the European Championship. During the summer of 1976, Aulcie Perry was spotted by a scout for Maccabi Tel Aviv while playing at the Rucker courts in Harlem and was quickly signed to play for their fledgling team. The Israeli players immediately responded to Aulcie's leadership and that year they had what one Sports Illustrated writer described as ""the most extraordinary season in its remarkable history"" and what Perry later called ""the best nine months of my life."" In 1977, Perry helped the team to its first European Championship, a prize they took four years later again under his leadership. After the season, to the surprise of many, Aulcie Perry converted to Judaism, adopted the Hebrew name Elisha Ben Avraham, and became an Israeli citizen.

AmeriCaN_TeRRoRiST,0,"A new film by Joseph D. Bonczyk. This endeavor addresses the continuing disaster that is the modern school shooter/bomber era, which commenced on April 20, 1999 in Littleton, Colorado. After planning for more than a year, two teenagers drove from their comfortable suburban homes toting more than 90 homemade bombs and a cache of firearms to school intending to blow Columbine High off the face of the planet, killing hundreds of their classmates and teachers in the process. At 11:19 a.m on April 20, 1999. when the two large bombs they had planted in the Columbine HIgh School cafeteria failed to detonate, the 17 and 18 year old killers moved into active shooter mode, murdering 13 people in cold blood. They also wounded more than 20 others, and then committed suicide in the school library where most of the carnage had occurred. Columbine has been the blueprint for countless other mass shootings that have occurred through the years as perpetrated by American teenagers and early 20-somethings, each one more shocking than the last. Copycats known as ""Columbinites"" have popped up in other parts of the world as well, including in Crimea the Ukrane when on October 17, 2018 an 18-year-old student shot 20 people to death and wounded 70 more before committing suicide, just like his heroes, in the school library.

Divine Instinct,0,"Gary Spinosa stepped away from his growing reputation among the handful of rising sculptors in the world, choosing instead to study and follow his artistic vision on a 28-acre farm in Venango, Pennsylvania. For thirty years, he's lived a reclusive life working seven days a week on his art, passing through phases of Mummies, Portals, Icons and hand-sized ceramic pieces he calls Stones. His work transcends our modern pathological consumption as well as the consumer art that defines our society. We step into his world of dreams, transformed by a spiritual consciousness that skirts, or perhaps more accurately blends, Christianity with ancient gods and Paganism, and Reality with the Metaphysical. Spinosa's work transfixes the viewer like the Sirens of Ancient Greek mythology, but Spinosa isn't luring you to a shipwreck. He guides you on a journey into the psyche, both ancient and fresh in an Archaic Revival. The documentary walks you along Spinosa's past, by his canary-yellow Ford Pinto rusting back into the earth, to his heart-wrenching inability to create for years, to a redemptive art and life that soothes with its gentleness and challenges with its audacity. The Spinosa Project will make you ache for something better for your own living soul and reminds us that Art may be humanities' truest legacy.",2020,Documentary            ,James Gossard,,0,

The Search for Count Dante,90,"FATHER OF US MIXED MARTIAL ARTS, HAIRDRESSER, and much more. In the 1960s and 70s, his scowl was unmistakable and his kung fu pose conveyed a menace that went beyond martial arts mastery. He called himself Count Dante and he claimed to be ""The Deadliest Man Alive"" in garish comic book ads and gruesome instructional manuals. While his name and title may have been more show biz than lineage, his drive to live up to his fearsome reputation left one man dead and a promising career in ruins. Count Dante's real name was John Keehan and he grew up in a posh section of Chicago. In the early 1960s he was one of the most intriguing figures in America's nascent martial arts scene. Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris were his contemporaries, but Keehan's appetite for self-promotion was greater than a movie star's. When he wasn't putting on karate tournaments, he was styling hair and courting Playboy Bunnies. He was one part ""Black Belt Jones"" and one part Warren Beatty from ""Shampoo."" He challenged Muhammad Ali, tested his hand speed against a quick draw artist, and kept an African lion as a house pet. But as the 1960s gave way to the 70s, Keehan could no longer separate himself from the macho marketing tool that he created. Rival dojos were stormed, the life of Keehan's best friend was lost and Dante became involved in the Purolator Armored Car Robbery in 1974 that netted four million dollars. Soon after the robbery, Dante mysteriously died and was buried in an unmarked grave.",2020,Action            ,"Jimmy Jones, Gene LeBell, Robert Wall",Floyd Webb,0,

I think that motion capture could be a good way to ricreate emotions in the astronomical bodies,designed with a good and smart use of the computer.The book and the movie should link common people to the wonder of the universe and let the public consider scientific phenomenas from a new view,giving a sensitive answer for eclipses,explosions or the light.

Making her decision all the more difficult, Mary was accepted to every university to which she applied.

But her mind is made up and, when she puts her mind to something, she focuses on it and won't let go until it's done. Then something happens; in the middle of the battle with her dad, she discovers that the town actually could use new leadership and some forward thinking. A fresh coat of paint wouldn't hurt either. Once a great summer vacation community, the town has suffered, along with other small American towns in recent years. Small businesses have closed their doors and main Street is disappearing. Mary comes up with some out of the box solutions that ignite and inspire the town. It looks like she might just win....

On April 1, 2018, while in the middle of shooting his fortieth feature, Harry is killed in the most preposterous possible way - he's hit by a piece of the Chinese Tiangong 1 space station that did not burn up during re-entry, making him the first person to ever be killed by a piece of space junk. Harry becomes the unwilling donor in a heart transplant operation, the recipient of which is the dreaded Julia Philkins, ""the biggest shark producer in Hollywood"", before finding himself at The Re-Cycling Center, an ethereal netherworld where he awaits his Letters of Transit so he can be re-cycled back to real life. His case worker at the center is Ariel, a vivacious young woman from Fort Lee, New Jersey, who had dreamed of becoming a film actress before her untimely demise in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Harry and Ariel's topsy-turvy May-December romance plays out while Julia creates chaos in Hollywood by morphing into another Harry and abruptly turning away from CGI-driven comic book films to intimate human stories. Julia drags the rest of the industry's copycat producers with her, leaving 5.000 VFx artists out of work and the streets of Hollywood looking like a remake of the last reel of ""The Day of the Locust."" The premiere of Julia's new film and the opening night of Harry and Ariel's stage production at the Re-Cycling Center Theater coincide, resulting in a collision of the forces of life and death, love and loss.",2020,Comedy            ,"Laura Justad, Edd Robinson, Miles Snow, Neill Fleeman",Neill Fleeman,0,

Basically, something else will get you first. However, given Max's age and otherwise great physical shape, his urologist, Dr. Hap, recommends a radical prostatectomy - surgical removal of the cancerous prostate. Max is torn between Dr. Hap's opinion and the adamant stance championed by his (behind-the-scenes) significant other who protests that surgery would be a drastic mistake. No, Max's significant isn't his girlfriend, and not a 'best friend with benefits.' It's his 'pal' joey who, by-the-way, shares the same birth date as Max.
