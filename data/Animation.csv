Justin Time,22,"Justin Time is a Canadian animated television series for pre-school aged children, created by Brandon James Scott. The show airs on Disney Junior (both English and French) in Canada, the Sprout channel in the United States, Tiny Pop in the United Kingdom, and Kids Talk Talk Plus in South Korea. The show revolves around the adventures of Justin. In every episode, Justin encounters a real-world problem of everyday childhood (such as sharing, teamwork, or paying attention). Then Justin and his shape-shifting sidekick Squidgy solve the problems by tackling them in imaginary adventures through time and around the world. In every adventure, Justin and Squidgy meet their best friend Olive, who always lives in the place and time they are visiting, and who usually needs their help to accomplish a task. Together, the three of them encounter the same problem that Justin faces in the real world, and together they solve the problem before Justin's parents call him back to the real world. In the original concept, Justin travelled via a time machine, which led to the title ""Justin Time"".[1] Because the concept of ""the past"" is challenging for pre-schoolers, the show instead focuses on more developmentally appropriate adventures of make-believe. It is noticed that the Canadian flag is blue and white instead of its official red and white in the theme song. In November 2014 it was announced that Netflix were to create a new original spin-off series entitled 'Justin Time: The New Adventures. The spin-off will follow Justin and best friends Olive and Squidgy on more fantastical adventures around the globe, and will comprise of thirteen half-hour episodes to be released for streaming in early 2016.[2] Justin Time was nominated for a 2013 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Pre-School Animated Program,[3] and for a 2013 Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production For Preschool Children.[4] ""Brandon Scott James Blog"".

Candide,100,"We believe that adapting Voltaire's Candide (originally published in 1759) in a free way entirely based on contemporary references, is a revolutionary mission. Not only because it is a rare take on animation as a genre, but also because - in a much entertaining way - it is a critical interpretation of the challenges imposed on core democratic values. This is a series that isn't just a visual gag or a wonderfully cheap laugh, but it also looks some very hard realities of life straight in the eye. We are convinced that there is a need among the audience to watch culturally rich, thoughtful unique animation shows, which reflect on our current situation in a satirical tone. Imagine Candide as the new show completely aware of The Amazing World of Gumball, as well as South Park, Rick and Morty or Bojack Horseman, yet with a distinguished graphic design, and characters partly 18th century partly 21st century style. Candide is a non-conventional show, it works with witty, critical thinking yet it quotes popular topics from mass media, like cutting out Rainforests, climate change and the political-financial elite, the effects of terrorism, life in warzones, unresolved immigration issues, emerging dictatorship, challenges of the high tech lifestyles, or man in space. It is made in the spirit of Voltaire, but it takes place in today's globalized world, therefore there are many ways to see ourselves in this mirror .",2018,"Animation, Action, Adventure            ",,,18,,8.0

The film is a mixture of live action and animation filmed in various techniques. In many scenes images coalesce into tableaus. Each subject is given apparent levels of meaning, which in turn stand beside and on top of one another on equal footing. The meaninglessness of that which seems so certain such as gender or age is exposed with great relish. The individual threads run parallel, only touching occasionally but nevertheless influencing the overall image. Boule de suif is ultimately sold down the river. The visual language in its complexity is reminiscent of commercial television, particularly of infomercials with their continuous fade-ins and over-blendings. The shifts in meaning inevitably evoke contradictions that at times seem bizarre.

"The Beatles, Hippies and Hells Angels: Inside the Crazy World of Apple",90,"It's 1967 and the Beatles face a major problem: they are the most famous, commercially successful band ever, but their tax bills could bankrupt them. Their answer is to invest their money in a new company, Apple Corps. Today Apple Corps just runs the Beatles back catalogue, but for five glorious years in the late sixties, it was one of the most colourful, outlandish and chaotic companies that ever existed. The Beatles set up a fashion shop, hair dressing salon, tech start-up (Apple before Apple), poetry division, film production department and of course their own record label. The idea was to spread the values of the new Hippie movement around the world. But things will go wrong, if you drop acid during office hours. In this unauthorised film, the true inside story behind Apple is told by the people who worked for the company, from record label executives and the Beatles personal assistants to the office boys and secretaries. Their inside stories are illustrated by never-before-seen archives of photographs taken in Apple's offices, plus specially-commissioned animation and rare archive footage. What emerges is a comic cautionary tale about the peaks and pitfalls of Hippie-dom. The film is narrated by Peter Coyote, legendary counter-cultural activist, actor and author, who visited Apple's offices with the Hells Angels in 1968 As Beatles longtime assistant Tony Bramwell says ""How can you be a Hippie, when you are earning a million pounds a week?""",2017,"Documentary, Animation, History            ",Ben Lewis,,16,,7.5

Amid the insect-adventures, audiences will get a bug's-eye view of the habits and habitats of actual insects of many kinds, and will learn how these creatures thrive in their environments. Imagine children everywhere sitting down to be entertained, and getting up with a new understanding of the world around them! In Brainy Bubbly Bug Buddies, characters thrive in a lush wetland paradise. Among its inhabitants are Bartle Bee, the fencing-master bumblebee; Flutterby, the elegant butterfly; Strobe and Sparkle, the heart-of-gold firefly brothers; and McBroom, the hardest-working beetle in the land. The Marsh is always buzzing with activity, and little viewers will be captivated by the lively blend of action and discovery to be found in its colorful environs. Our exoskeletal heroes bring their collective skills and ingenuity to bear on life's challenges in The Marsh, and in the end, they are rewarded for their efforts. Young learners are thus reminded that problem-solving is often best accomplished as a joint effort-and, coincidentally, that we live in a vast world worthy of exploration at even the most minute level of existence. Regular visits to The Marsh will delight and intrigue, all while nurturing children's budding quest for knowledge-and imbuing them with a healthy respect for life in the natural realm.",2011,Animation            ,"Siobhan Lumsden, Paul 'Maxx' Rinehart, Justin J.

Unseen: The Lives of Looking,90,"Artist Dryden Goodwin's first feature-length essay film, focuses on four individuals with extraordinary relationships to looking: an international eye surgeon, a NASA planetary explorer, a leading human rights lawyer and the artist/filmmaker himself. Mixing Goodwin's closely observed drawings, live action and intricately woven soundtrack, the film explores different scales, forms and reasons for looking, in a poetic and metaphysically charged journey. Revealed through intimate access is the empathy and dexterity of the surgeon working with the fragility of the human eye; the quest of the planetary explorer to decipher the cosmos and find evidence of life on Mars; and the scrutiny of the British government, by the lawyer, in extraordinary rendition, drone attack and mass surveillance cases. Goodwin's looking and implicit presence links the lives of these probing observers, exposing a kinship between those who live by the sensory rules of observation, a desire to decode in pursuit of knowledge and insight. The film's perspectives range from the minute details of surgery to panoramic expanses of space. Vignettes of strangers and a brief focus on Goodwin's father and son, invite us to contemplate the known and the unknown, the personal and the remote. Exposing the imaginative leaps we take to reveal what might be concealed or out of sight, the film considers the physical act of looking and the tools we use to perceive the world around us and how these form our own identities.",2015,"Documentary, Animation            ",Dryden Goodwin,,10,,5.5

Time Rodent,15,"Time rodent is a grotesque, strongly visually and colourfully stylized short film. Using distinctive animation, it tells the story of the world in 5, 10 or even 100,000 years in an abstract parable, a kind of civilizational, comic anti-fairy-tale about the gradual decay of the world and further possible evolutional transformation of its inhabitants. The protagonist of this story is a witness to this process - a half humanoid, half animal creature going through the individual periods of our future on earth. In his art Ondrej Svadlena pushes the boundaries of modern 3D animation, that can withstand even the most exacting critical standards. It builds on loose, emotional storytelling and impeccable 3D animation to evoke apocalyptic, romantic and surreal fantasies. He is connected to Czech culture by his dark humor and sense of absurdity which is reflected in his dizzyingly morbid, wordless carnivals of futuristic imagination and echoes of the atmosphere of communist era industrialism.",2016,"Animation, Short, Sci-Fi            ",Ondrej Svadlena,,6,,5.8

Chess is a game that is surrounded in mystique and intrigue, and where its champions are hailed as society's brightest and most intelligent. Through wars, chess has both been spread and adopted by the conquerors, each empire influencing the game and being influenced by it, whilst attaching it to bold symbolism. For Harun Al Rashid's empire, chess reflected the teachings of Islam and its emphasis on intellect over luck. For the mighty Queen Isabella of Spain, co-sponsor of Christopher Columbus' voyage that discovered America, the game evolved to reflect her ruthless power. For the U.S.A. and Soviet Union, the Championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky became a proxy battle in the midst of the Cold War. Through 15 centuries, from its ancient roots to the silicon age, chess has endured and found its way into the modern day as it continues to be played by millions of people around the world.",2014,"Documentary, Animation, Short            ",Mike Walker,Shamir Allibhai,0,,0.0

Yellow Sticky Notes: Canadian Anijam,8,"For the first time in Canadian history, 15 of Canada's most award-winning and celebrated independent animators have come together to create a collaborative animated film. Yellow Sticky Notes - Canadian Anijam is an innovative and global approach to animation filmmaking and unites animators from coast to coast, from Vancouver to Halifax and all parts in between, to self reflect on one day of their lives using only 4x6 inch yellow sticky notes, a black pen and animation meditation. Featuring animation from the original Anijam creator Marv Newland along with Oscar® winners Alison Snowden and David Fine and Academy® Award nominees Cordell Barker, Janet Perlman, Chris Hinton, and Paul Driessen. To create the film, the animators were asked to self-reflect through animation on personal and global events that impacted one day of their lives. Each of the animators created their sequences independent of knowing what the other participants were creating. Starting with a 'to do' list written on the day of a life-altering event, the animators transitioned from text to imagery by utilizing 'animation meditation' to create a visual animated poem representing how their lives were affected by that pivotal day. In the end, the thousands of sticky note drawings link together to create a dynamic and inspirational animated film that connects the human spirit while celebrating individual artistic expression with the goal of inspiring future generations of animators.",2013,"Documentary, Animation, Short            ",Jeff Chiba Stearns,,31,,6.9

It's a Wonderful Loaf,7,"A colorful whimsy of an animated poem, produced, designed and animated by Little Fluffy Clouds for the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Created in a painterly style the animation evokes the watercolor paintings of artists, J.M.W. Turner and John Singer Sargent. The piece is nestled within a colorful, dreamy, richly textured, pre-WWII Europe illustrating a host of working men and women - porters, bakers, millers, farmers, dockers, waiters and more - going about their daily life. The poem, written and narrated by economist, educator and Hoover Fellow, Russ Roberts, explores the seemingly magical ways that we anticipate the needs of others without anyone actually orchestrating things. Primarily devised as a teaching tool, the animated video is partnered with a website that encourages economics students and teachers alike to delve deeper into the ideas of Roberts' economic doctrine. The original score, which fits the animation like a silk glove, was penned by the talented duo at pop Tuna, Monica Pasqual and BZ Lewis. The 60-second teaser has its own variation on the original theme. Little Fluffy Clouds produced, designed and animated three versions: a 60-second teaser, the full seven-minute version and the same with on-screen text animation. LFC is a multi-award winning, full service Bay Area animation production studio headed up by the multi-talented twosome of Jerry van de Beek and Betsy De Fries.",2017,"Animation, Short            ","Jerry van de Beek, Betsy de Fries",,0,,0.0

"Beep, Beep, Beep",3,"One of the most famous piano pieces of all time - Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. One of the most familiar and frustrating experiences a driver can have - being stuck at a red light. You wouldn't think these two elements would work well together - but they do (brilliantly, in fact) in the very catchy, very amusing ""Beep, Beep, Beep."" Written and recorded by Richard Perlmutter for one of his Grammy Award-nominated ""Beethoven's Wig"" albums [which put clever lyrics to well-known classical composition] the song retains the melancholy beauty of the original piece, but the lyrics add an amusing new twist: the story of a man stuck in traffic, waiting in vain for the light to change. As he waits, and waits, traffic starts building behind him. First one car, then two, then three - the light remains stubbornly red. The drivers behind him, in turn, take out their frustration - on the lead car, on the light, perhaps even on the cosmic injustice of it all - by honking their horns. The driver in front tries to remain patient, but irritation pushes him past the ""beeping point"" and he joins in the futile cacophony of horns, until... well, why spoil the ending? It's an amazing song - the lyrics work so well with the music that it seems like they were always there [though we dutifully realize there were no cars in 1801].",2012,"Animation, Short            ",Jeremy Diamond,,0,,0.0

The piece is humorous and visually enthralling, as the audience is devoid of visuals apart from the words spoken, which are presented rhythmically onscreen, mimicking the mother - daughter conversation. The words become themselves protagonists, in this dance of colloquial language, which not only underlines the organic aspects of the spoken, but also permits the viewer to create a secondary space, an imaginary space, resulting from a lack of literary visual imagery. The conversation, although trivial, touches upon universal themes such as war, regret, family history and the holocaust.",2015,"Animation, Short            ",Pia Ilonka Schenk Jensen,,0,,0.0

They hired Walt Disney to produce animated cartoons, most of which focused upon Latin America as subject, some of theses videos took on health issues, such as malaria, water treatment and tuberculosis as well as produced animated characters as visual representations for these countries. In Paul Pescador's full length essay film, he reconsiders these films and their relationship between cultural diplomacy and colonialism.

Fundamental,8,"The animation is based on a self-experience. It is about the injury of rigid religious upbringing to a teenager who discovers the strange and terrifying reality behind fundamentalism. Warped into an ultra-religious environment from a young age, his surroundings force him to adhere to a rigid and sometimes irrational world-view. He eventually succumbs to the madness, and lives consumed by guilt while devouring every crumb of false hope thrown at him from his religious community. One day he gathers the courage to leave his faith behind, and sees that human existence is actually a more nuanced experience than the black and white reality in which he grew up in. By using metaphors of signs and symbols, the animation highlights and describes the mental illness caused by the conservative church on the lead character and illustrates how the character makes his way out from his dire situation.",2017,"Animation, Short            ",Shih-chieh Chiu,,9,,7.8

Using the model of reality television programs on the obese, How to Decorate a Cake oscillates between blaming the women in Raymond's life as enablers of his appalling physical condition and highlighting the missed opportunities of Raymond to save himself. In the film weight is used as a metaphor for psychological dysfunction. Raymond's diet consists entirely of breast milk provided by his mother Beryl. As the film progresses Beryl's breasts undergo a dramatic transformation. As Raymond's body swells, Beryl's breasts deflate. The inappropriate intimacy between a mother and her son positions Beryl as a nurturer and as an agent of harm. This absurd scenario of weight transference and the sharing of body fluids is used as a strategy to discuss the power of food as a substitute for emotional and physical intimacy.",2017,"Animation, Short            ",Kiri-Marie Mitchell,,0,,0.0

Collaging Film,125,"""Collaging Film"" is a series of shorts dating back to 2007. Published NY artist and writer, Stephen Mead, started out fairly bare-bones when beginning to make films, an experimentation which he considered a sort of folk art. Eventually Stephen transitioned from the use of subtitles in his work to creating his own mp3s for soundtracks and effects, finally interweaving actual footage amid paintings and digitized images in hopes of creating a more engaging experience for the viewer. As a Folk Artist, mainly using Windows Movie Maker, a program on many-a-computer, Stephen enjoys the fact that most anyone can use this program to make films of their own. He also likes knowing that these films are ""low-tech Independents"", not subject to Studio Backing (!) and meant to be viewed on the small screens of televisions or computer monitors. Stephen feels this creates for a more intimate viewing experience that is perfect for the variety of themes found in his work. This second disc of Stephen Mead's shorts includes his music videos for the CD song cycle, ""Whispers of Arias, Volumes 1 and 2"". These include ""Rings"", a remembrance piece for 911, and ""Patroclus"", a homage to same-sex love. To round out the collection is ""Our Collage Life"" created for the ""It Gets Better"" project.",2012,Animation            ,Stephen Mead,Stephen Mead,0,,0.0

The Arksville Homicides,4,"1541: Famed Spanish Explorer Francisco Vasquez de Coronado is heading through what is now modern day Kansas on a mission. A box containing unknown contents that has been kept sealed under lock and key by the Vatican has been delivered to him to take far from civilization and bury as deep in the Earth as possible, never to be found again. 1967 Arksville lies within the forests of Pennsylvania. It is a large town on the verge of being a city. Since the closure of the local coal mine in 1931, and sighting themselves as a 'get away from it all' hamlet, tucked into rural Pennsylvania alongside the Susquehanna River the town has thrived on tourism. Frank Wepps and his family escape from a horrible dark event in Frank's police work in Pittsburgh, hoping to start afresh in Arksville, Frank has a new position at the Arksville Police Department. Frank's superior - Lieutenant Eidalman, a cynical and jaded cop, once idealistic but now just sick of the bureaucracy, control and corruption of the town council. Chief Gardner of the Police Department is deep in the council's pocket and in an effort to keep the image of the town pleasant, his department only reports a fraction of the actual crimes. They even occasionally collude with the local crime family which uses Arksville as a conduit for arms-smuggling. Mayor Adinberry's only concern is money, and the grand image of the town. But something is wrong from the start of Frank's arrival - the feeling someone is stalking his family. Sure enough a figure that has a strange unearthly feel is seen following his daughter - Patricia, and his wife - Lucy. Soon bodies begin turning up around the town, locals being dispatched brutally and horrifically, mutilated beyond imagination. What follows in a private manhunt for someone or something lurking in the alleyways and town fringes of Arksville. Primary suspects being a cult led by a recluse named Harold Dyer, Frank and Eidalman are unable to obtain any proof, and with influence coming into the town from the local crime family, the police's hands are busy enough. Working against the town council, the local crime family and the satanic cult, Frank and Eidalman will have a front-row seat at a showdown between good and evil.",2013,"Animation, Short, Horror            ","Jennifer Bainbridge, Dallas Barnett, Natalie Beran, Eddie Booze",Lewis Roscoe,6,,8.5

The film is ""hosted"" by a confused public access Dracula (played by Kevin Leggatt) who introduces the viewers to an onslaught of images including pugs, no budget horror films, collaged images, a news bulletin consisting of a falling cat landing on its feet, among other things, all surrounded by a visual commentary in the form of direct animation.",2015,"Animation, Short            ",Winston Hacking,,0,,0.0

Mobile Devices,5,"For thousands of years, American bison have roamed the North American plains. Modest historical estimates suggest that, at one point, 24-million bison inhabited the continent. This number began to decrease coinciding with the arrival of non-native settlers and the European subspecies Equus ferus caballus, otherwise known as the domesticated horse. The introduction of the horse triggered an existential threat for the bison. Horses extended the hunting prowess of humans by providing a weaponized resource that afforded enhanced distance and speed. In addition to human hunters, the destruction of the bison corresponds with the arrival of the horse. Mobile Devices intends to draw a similar parallel between the arrival of digital technology and the extinction of our precious human nature. As a species, have we legitimately considered the consequences of augmenting our relationship with space, time, and memory?
