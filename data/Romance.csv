Duncan strikes gold in an abandoned amusement park, presided over by a lonely ex-carnival worker -- Henry. Assembling the mechanical monstrosity is not exactly a one-man job. Duncan gets a crucial assist from Tommy, a former student of Suzy's, who is deeply in her debt. He's become a successful landscape designer after a troubled youth; it was Suzy who set him straight. Meanwhile, the neighbors are not amused; especially prim and proper Gayle Matthews. She's entered her garden in an upscale magazine's ""Christmas Showcase"" contest. The interest of the contest's judges witnessing the atrocity next door is more than Gayle can bear. Fortunately, her brother is the local sheriff - and there are zoning laws to prevent this kind of thing, aren't there?",2013,"Drama, Romance            ","Andy Garcia, Mandy Moore, Cheri Oteri, Riley Smith",John Kent Harrison,1492,,6.8

Killing for Love,130,"The gruesome murders of Nancy and Derek Haysom in 1985 were an international media sensation. The Haysoms were wealthy, respected members of Virginia society, and the murder conviction of their daughter Elizabeth and her German boyfriend Jens Soering sent shock waves through the rural community of Bedford County. Elizabeth and Jens had met in a university program for high achieving students. She was a product of European boarding schools, he was the son of a diplomat. After being arrested in London, England, for passing bad checks in 1986, they were both extradited to the United States and have now spent over 30 years behind bars. This beautifully crafted film reveals a mismanaged, or perhaps completely corrupted, judicial process. This was the first criminal trial held in front of TV cameras - the first high-profile, international case tried in a small town. Investigations over the past 3 years have turned up stunning evidence that was previously suppressed or deemed inadmissible. New forensic techniques have disproven evidence that was key to Soering's original conviction. Denied parole 12 times, his next hearing in 2017 may have a different outcome, at the same time the film is in release. Unidentified fingerprints, photographic evidence that points to sexual abuse, the presiding judge's friendship with the victims, a missing FBI profile, a bloody car with a knife under the seat - all point to a very different story, one that is revealed in the film.",2016,"Documentary, Crime, Romance            ","Imogen Poots, Daniel Brühl, Jens Söring, Chuck Reid","Marcus Vetter, Karin Steinberger",1282,,7.1

After not pursuing romance for most of her adult life, Hannah Swensen, owner/operator of Hannah's Cookie Jar, a bakery/café, is being wooed by two men, who know about the other in Hannah's life. Hannah likes both a lot, but has not even kissed either. While her mother, Delores Swensen, is pushing her into the arms of dentist Norman Rhodes as the person who will provide her with a stable, comfortable life, her sister, Andrea Todd, is pushing her into the arms of Andrea's deputy sheriff husband Bill Todd's colleague, police detective Mike Kingston, as the more exciting choice. What seems to be becoming a more chronic issue in Hannah's life is that she is the person who finds someone murdered in Eden Lake, this time the victim being one of her customers, Larry Jaeger, co-owner of the Crazy Elf Christmas tree lot with his fiancée, Courtney Miller, the two who got engaged after knowing each other for only six weeks. Larry's murder is only the second such in recent memory in the town, and the second such body Hannah has discovered. Hannah can't help but get involved in the investigation, either by accident or usually more on purpose, which irks both Norman and Mike as putting her life in danger. Mike is additionally bothered that her amateur sleuthing is interfering with his official investigation. At the top of the suspect list is Delores' friend, Nancy Schmidt who is better known in town as radio talk show host on issues of the lovelorn, Dr. Love. Nancy is not Larry's ex-wife as she had implied to Delores, but rather his wife - at least up until his murder - he who she claims not to have seen in ten years as he bilked her out of her money and disappeared without a trace until now. The further Hannah and Mike investigate, the further they find that Larry was generally not a nice person who had many enemies who had motive to want to see him dead. What Hannah may or may not be aware is that she is getting closer to the truth which truly does put her life in danger as the murderer would probably not hesitate to murder a second time if she gets too close to discovering the truth.",2015,"Crime, Mystery, Romance            ","Alison Sweeney, Cameron Mathison, Barbara Niven, Lisa Durupt",Kristoffer Tabori,1068,,7.0

Are You for Great Sex?,102,"Are You For Great Sex? is a boundary-pushing, raw, and sophisticated sexual love story told from a uniquely fresh, woman's point of view. Directed by Cynthia Hsiung, and based on a true story, the movie wrestles with a central question: What is the meaning of great sex? Is it just a primal instinctual act? Or is there something deeper that a great sexual connection tells us about ourselves? There's great sex, and then there's unforgettable sex. That's what Thea and Mateas have had for more than a decade. Both New Yorkers in consuming professions, they consider their relationship to be ""just"" sexual and live out their separate lives. Over the years of this on-again-off-again, modern-epic romance, Thea copes with an unhappy marriage, a mother with Alzheimer's disease, and the pressure of her fertility clock. Mateas pursues a demanding career as a world-traveling consultant, and lives with its attendant emotional isolation while taking financial care of his ailing father. What remains unchanged is their sensational sexual chemistry - and a secret that emerges out of a bizarre series of events, forcing them to examine their lives on a profound level. Shining a spotlight on what it means to have a connection that is both highly sexual and deeply soulful, Are You For Great Sex? comments on contemporary definitions of love and has already inspired viewers to email their first loves, change up their sex lives, and evaluate their relationships. For everyone who wants to learn your greatest inner truth, ask yourself: Are You For Great Sex?

Known as ""the Hulk Hogan of American politics,"" his endorsements swayed presidential elections and three of his books became action movies, which he starred in. Uncle Sam lost it all because of his addictions to gambling, alcohol, women, and drugs. His release from rehab legally requires a halfway house, but none can take him due to his high profile. A magistrate allows his nephew Kevin Armstrong (Brian Kirk) to take him in. Kevin, 39, has idolized Sam for a lifetime, and is eager to give back to the uncle who helped shape him through his books, movies, and love. A hard ­working and driven man, Kevin is a struggling real estate agent. He's grown skeptical of the federal government, viewing it as the primary obstacle to success, echoing sentiments from Sam's books. Kevin grows disillusioned when he sees that Sam has become utterly dependent on him, to the point of emotional and financial exhaustion. Sam spends thousands of Kevin's dollars without asking, and when confronted, questions Kevin's loyalty as a nephew. Once Kevin works up the courage to cut Sam off financially, his uncle signs up for a Bank of Asia ""Vice"" card, using Kevin's name. Sam begins buying items with the card, reselling them for cash, in order to feed his drug habit and keep his gambling debt collector at bay. Kevin's best friend and boss, real estate broker Jake Joseph (Declan Joyce), has a secret family in Albania that needs his financial support. Working behind the scenes with Uncle Sam, Jake recruits former ""dancer"" Heather (Theresa Carissimi) to pose as a client and love interest, distracting Kevin from the damage being done to his bank accounts. The office manager at Kevin's brokerage (Lulu Braha) warned Kevin about Sam from the beginning, to no avail.

The Method of Love,0,"On the surface, Chris Nduka is the picture-perfect man: charming, attractive and a very successful businessman. Women are enamoured and intrigued by him. However with his obsessive desires and preference for sex over love, committing to just one woman is as remote to him as taking a sabbatical to Tibet to be the Dalai Lama's understudy. In direct contrast, his newly wed brother Niko's enthusiastic show of love and romance, is at best nauseating and borderline uncomfortable to witness. He gushes over his wife April, in a fashion that suggests he is the first man on earth to experience such euphoria. But behind each brother's expression of love and affection, lies their troubled and dark childhood, that has rendered one brother obsessively in love with the idea of love, and the other incapable of showing love or forming a healthy relationship. Using London's buzzing streets as a backdrop, we witness the hazardous journey of self-discovery in the quest to find true love, through the lives of the show's central characters: The ambitious and confident Chloe, in a long-term relationship with successful video producer Anthony, struggles with recently developed feelings for another man which are both alarming and worrying, as they raise questions about her future with Anthony. Frankie, the overly confident, witty ladies' man and Chris' best friend, wears the exterior of a sexist egotistical male, who is happy to brag about female conquests. Beneath, however, he hides a deeper secret of insecurity and desperation for acceptance, that threatens not only to offer him a lifetime of misery but could be to the detriment of his friendship with Chris. Finally, we have the mysterious Charlotte, a widow who is still deeply grieving over the death of her husband, 2 years ago. She is struggling to find someone to live up to the impossible image her grief has created of her lost love, whilst in the meantime relying on less than perfect means to cope with each day. The Method of Love is a clever critique of the human condition, allowing us to navigate through the characters' innermost fears, passions and revelations, as each element of their lives continually forces them to question the very essence of love.",2014,"Comedy, Drama, Romance            ","Charles Venn, Alexandra Afryea, Tyler Fayose, Marsha Leanne Crosby","Wayne Campbell, Charles Venn",0,,0.0

In a small village of West Bengal - Swapna and Shucheta - two young women in love with each other - took their own lives, leaving a letter claiming love, life, recognition... a letter challenging violence, hate, invisibilisation. No one from their families came to claim their dead bodies. They died as they dared to love. Their bodies remained unclaimed by family and society. What if they were not dead but alive today? Like many other couples, Aparna-Kajlee from Bongaaon, Moyna-Bandana from Purulia... They died for love but still live among us. What if Swapna and Shucheta ran away and survived? How would their life together look like and their desire? If you dare Desire, is a film of possibilities.

In the daily struggles of a far-away village. In the dark glitters of a big city. If you dare Desire, is a wish-fulfilling cinema. A hyper-reality of desire. A politics of hope.

The class involves students making a series of short films that involve both a technical and a thematic constraint - akin in some respects to Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth's The Five Obstructions (2003), which is the first film that participants watch as part of the class. The class also invites participants to draw on a history of guerrilla filmmaking from around the world, reading important texts and manifestos by filmmakers like Julio García Espinosa, Fernando E. Solanas and Octavio Getino, Glauber Rocha, Jia Zhangke and Wu Wenguang. Participants also watch and gain inspiration from work by zero- to micro-budget filmmakers like Giuseppe Andrews, Ai Weiwei, Khavn de la Cruz, Mike Ott and Harmony Korine. Roehampton Guerrillas (2011-2016) features 39 short films by 31 different filmmakers, and which respond to eight different challenges set to participants on the course. The films, chosen from among 100s made during the first five years of the Guerrilla Filmmaking course, are all packed in to a 127-minute running time. Short on time, with no technical support, and forced to make films about topics and using techniques that are not of their choosing, the Roehampton Guerrillas prove the following:- You don't need money to make a film. You don't even need a camera. You only need an idea. Limitations do not hinder creativity.

Amore tra le rovine,68,"A love letter to early Italian cinema, Love Among the Ruins is a faux documentary about the miraculous discovery and restoration of a long-lost Italian silent film. The genius of the Lumini brothers, two cinematic visionaries almost overlooked in the history of cinema, ignites the imagination of a contemporary filmmaker who makes the discovery of a lifetime. In 2012, a 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck northern Italy, severely affecting the historic city of Ferrara and surrounding areas and causing significant damage to the region's Medieval and Renaissance architecture. However, a cracked wall in Ferrara's municipal building revealed a hidden treasure: several cans of old film. Could this be the long-lost silent romance written and directed by the Lumini brothers of Ferrara in the early 1920s? Can the deteriorated film be repaired so new audiences around the world can enjoy this moving story of lovers caught in the events of World War I? Scholars speculate, experts and archivists hypothesize, and finally, the 90-year old film is restored and set to a new musical score. The talents of actors long passed away (or maybe not!) and the beauty of Ferrara in the 1920s (as well as today) are once again seen on the screen with a tale as striking and poignant for today's viewers as it was nearly a century ago.",2015,"Drama, Romance, War            ","Alexander la Rue, Stefano Muroni, Mary Di Tommaso, Edoardo Siravo",Massimo Alì Mohammad,62,,5.8
