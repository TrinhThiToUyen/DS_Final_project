After not pursuing romance for most of her adult life, Hannah Swensen, owner/operator of Hannah's Cookie Jar, a bakery/café, is being wooed by two men, who know about the other in Hannah's life. Hannah likes both a lot, but has not even kissed either. While her mother, Delores Swensen, is pushing her into the arms of dentist Norman Rhodes as the person who will provide her with a stable, comfortable life, her sister, Andrea Todd, is pushing her into the arms of Andrea's deputy sheriff husband Bill Todd's colleague, police detective Mike Kingston, as the more exciting choice. What seems to be becoming a more chronic issue in Hannah's life is that she is the person who finds someone murdered in Eden Lake, this time the victim being one of her customers, Larry Jaeger, co-owner of the Crazy Elf Christmas tree lot with his fiancée, Courtney Miller, the two who got engaged after knowing each other for only six weeks. Larry's murder is only the second such in recent memory in the town, and the second such body Hannah has discovered. Hannah can't help but get involved in the investigation, either by accident or usually more on purpose, which irks both Norman and Mike as putting her life in danger. Mike is additionally bothered that her amateur sleuthing is interfering with his official investigation. At the top of the suspect list is Delores' friend, Nancy Schmidt who is better known in town as radio talk show host on issues of the lovelorn, Dr. Love. Nancy is not Larry's ex-wife as she had implied to Delores, but rather his wife - at least up until his murder - he who she claims not to have seen in ten years as he bilked her out of her money and disappeared without a trace until now. The further Hannah and Mike investigate, the further they find that Larry was generally not a nice person who had many enemies who had motive to want to see him dead. What Hannah may or may not be aware is that she is getting closer to the truth which truly does put her life in danger as the murderer would probably not hesitate to murder a second time if she gets too close to discovering the truth.",2015,"Crime, Mystery, Romance            ","Alison Sweeney, Cameron Mathison, Barbara Niven, Lisa Durupt",Kristoffer Tabori,1067,,7.0

Killing for Love,130,"The gruesome murders of Nancy and Derek Haysom in 1985 were an international media sensation. The Haysoms were wealthy, respected members of Virginia society, and the murder conviction of their daughter Elizabeth and her German boyfriend Jens Soering sent shock waves through the rural community of Bedford County. Elizabeth and Jens had met in a university program for high achieving students. She was a product of European boarding schools, he was the son of a diplomat. After being arrested in London, England, for passing bad checks in 1986, they were both extradited to the United States and have now spent over 30 years behind bars. This beautifully crafted film reveals a mismanaged, or perhaps completely corrupted, judicial process. This was the first criminal trial held in front of TV cameras - the first high-profile, international case tried in a small town. Investigations over the past 3 years have turned up stunning evidence that was previously suppressed or deemed inadmissible. New forensic techniques have disproven evidence that was key to Soering's original conviction. Denied parole 12 times, his next hearing in 2017 may have a different outcome, at the same time the film is in release. Unidentified fingerprints, photographic evidence that points to sexual abuse, the presiding judge's friendship with the victims, a missing FBI profile, a bloody car with a knife under the seat - all point to a very different story, one that is revealed in the film.",2016,"Documentary, Crime, Romance            ","Imogen Poots, Daniel Brühl, Jens Söring, Chuck Reid","Marcus Vetter, Karin Steinberger",1280,,7.1

Are You for Great Sex?,102,"Are You For Great Sex? is a boundary-pushing, raw, and sophisticated sexual love story told from a uniquely fresh, woman's point of view. Directed by Cynthia Hsiung, and based on a true story, the movie wrestles with a central question: What is the meaning of great sex? Is it just a primal instinctual act? Or is there something deeper that a great sexual connection tells us about ourselves? There's great sex, and then there's unforgettable sex. That's what Thea and Mateas have had for more than a decade. Both New Yorkers in consuming professions, they consider their relationship to be ""just"" sexual and live out their separate lives. Over the years of this on-again-off-again, modern-epic romance, Thea copes with an unhappy marriage, a mother with Alzheimer's disease, and the pressure of her fertility clock. Mateas pursues a demanding career as a world-traveling consultant, and lives with its attendant emotional isolation while taking financial care of his ailing father. What remains unchanged is their sensational sexual chemistry - and a secret that emerges out of a bizarre series of events, forcing them to examine their lives on a profound level. Shining a spotlight on what it means to have a connection that is both highly sexual and deeply soulful, Are You For Great Sex? comments on contemporary definitions of love and has already inspired viewers to email their first loves, change up their sex lives, and evaluate their relationships. For everyone who wants to learn your greatest inner truth, ask yourself: Are You For Great Sex?

Kevin, 39, has idolized Sam for a lifetime, and is eager to give back to the uncle who helped shape him through his books, movies, and love. A hard ­working and driven man, Kevin is a struggling real estate agent. He's grown skeptical of the federal government, viewing it as the primary obstacle to success, echoing sentiments from Sam's books. Kevin grows disillusioned when he sees that Sam has become utterly dependent on him, to the point of emotional and financial exhaustion. Sam spends thousands of Kevin's dollars without asking, and when confronted, questions Kevin's loyalty as a nephew. Once Kevin works up the courage to cut Sam off financially, his uncle signs up for a Bank of Asia ""Vice"" card, using Kevin's name. Sam begins buying items with the card, reselling them for cash, in order to feed his drug habit and keep his gambling debt collector at bay. Kevin's best friend and boss, real estate broker Jake Joseph (Declan Joyce), has a secret family in Albania that needs his financial support. Working behind the scenes with Uncle Sam, Jake recruits former ""dancer"" Heather (Theresa Carissimi) to pose as a client and love interest, distracting Kevin from the damage being done to his bank accounts. The office manager at Kevin's brokerage (Lulu Braha) warned Kevin about Sam from the beginning, to no avail. Kevin's distraction is compounded when he begins to fall in love with the office manager's daughter, Lauren (Madylin Sweeten), whose sass and substance prove irresistible to him. Torn between family loyalty and self ­preservation, Kevin takes action.",2016,"Comedy, Crime, Drama            ","Craig Henne, Declan Joyce, Madylin Sweeten, Brian Kirk",Brian Kirk,11,,6.1

You Only Live Once,0,"YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE is a heartfelt screenplay about finding the courage to change and fall in love again after life (and others) had let you down... Through the four female characters of the film (Emily, an 18 year-old aspiring model, Ellen a not-so-typical American-Greek housewife from Astoria, Rebecca, a NY socialite, Betty, a down-an-out on her luck TV presenter), we begin to understand the complexity of the everyday challenges and the relationship issues they are facing (one out of eight women is going to face the challenge of breast cancer). And hopefully, we can transform ourselves, alter our perspective, and, ultimately, change our own complicated and distorted relationship and attitude towards breast-cancer patients. The mood, pace and overall tone of the film is unique since it is elevated far above the drama of the four leading female characters. They are searching for the light in the end of the tunnel.

The Method of Love,0,"On the surface, Chris Nduka is the picture-perfect man: charming, attractive and a very successful businessman. Women are enamoured and intrigued by him. However with his obsessive desires and preference for sex over love, committing to just one woman is as remote to him as taking a sabbatical to Tibet to be the Dalai Lama's understudy. In direct contrast, his newly wed brother Niko's enthusiastic show of love and romance, is at best nauseating and borderline uncomfortable to witness. He gushes over his wife April, in a fashion that suggests he is the first man on earth to experience such euphoria. But behind each brother's expression of love and affection, lies their troubled and dark childhood, that has rendered one brother obsessively in love with the idea of love, and the other incapable of showing love or forming a healthy relationship. Using London's buzzing streets as a backdrop, we witness the hazardous journey of self-discovery in the quest to find true love, through the lives of the show's central characters: The ambitious and confident Chloe, in a long-term relationship with successful video producer Anthony, struggles with recently developed feelings for another man which are both alarming and worrying, as they raise questions about her future with Anthony. Frankie, the overly confident, witty ladies' man and Chris' best friend, wears the exterior of a sexist egotistical male, who is happy to brag about female conquests. Beneath, however, he hides a deeper secret of insecurity and desperation for acceptance, that threatens not only to offer him a lifetime of misery but could be to the detriment of his friendship with Chris. Finally, we have the mysterious Charlotte, a widow who is still deeply grieving over the death of her husband, 2 years ago. She is struggling to find someone to live up to the impossible image her grief has created of her lost love, whilst in the meantime relying on less than perfect means to cope with each day. The Method of Love is a clever critique of the human condition, allowing us to navigate through the characters' innermost fears, passions and revelations, as each element of their lives continually forces them to question the very essence of love.",2014,"Comedy, Drama, Romance            ","Charles Venn, Alexandra Afryea, Tyler Fayose, Marsha Leanne Crosby","Wayne Campbell, Charles Venn",0,,0.0

The film flash forwards thirty years, when someone from her past catches up to her. She finds herself reliving old memories and suffers from the ""log kya kehenge"" (""what will people say"") syndrome when making the tough decision to share and discuss her past with her husband and daughters. ""Although inspired by Indian cinema, Now and Then portrays the universal emotion of love and showcases the timelessness of the emotion through two generations. As a film written and directed from a female perspective, Now and Then also touches upon the double standards that women may experience regarding the dating culture, even in today's modern world. These double standards force us to think twice before sharing our stories. We were aiming to bring all the glamour of a Bollywood film- the music, dance, drama- without that 3 hour time commitment or language barrier. We hope this film is relatable for people from various cultural backgrounds and ages."" -Mohitha Sripathi-",2016,"Short, Drama, Family            ","Nikki Chawla, Rome K.

Fishing became the opportunity for Anthony to impart wisdom and in general, correct his brother's impish behavior. Anthony was the old soul having grown up overnight to become the man of the house. Michael, though as intelligent as Anthony, remained wide-eyed; seeing only the possible and refusing to entertain the improbable. Despite this, the boys were more alike than different.

Michael, graduates from Annapolis and is serving overseas as a Navy Seal. Anthony, a helicopter pilot serves stateside. On a beautify southern, spring afternoon, The Elders a family (minus Michael) along with friends and neighbors take a canoe trip on the river.

RMS Titanic: The Story Biograph Told,60,"The harrowing story of a young newly married couple on their return honeymoon voyage. However, the groom is the son of the founder of Biograph Company, Henry Marvin. The 1912 news reads as follows... Miss Mary G. C. Farquharsen, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Farquharsen of 317 Riverside Drive, was married to Daniel Warren Marvin on Tuesday. The ceremony was performed in the home of the bride's parents by the Rev. Dr. John Caughey of the Harlem Presbyterian Church. The bridegroom was a son of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Norton Marvin, who was a founder of the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company. Mr. and Mrs. Marvin sailed on the Mauretania on Wednesday for a bridal trip of five weeks. Daniel and Mary boarded the Titanic at Southampton as first class passengers. They were returning to New York City from their honeymoon in Europe. They occupied cabin D-30. The RMS Titanic was the second of a trio of super-liners intended to dominate the transatlantic travel business. Owned by the White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland, Titanic was the largest passenger steamship in the world at the time of its launching. On the return voyage. it struck an iceberg at 11:40 PM (ship's time). On the night of the accident Daniel assisted his wife to a lifeboat with the words ""It's alright, little girl. You go. I will stay."". The RMS Titanic sank at 2:20 AM Monday morning on April 15, 1912. Among the crowds that gathered at the New York offices of White Star on April 15 1912 were relatives of both Daniel and Mary Marvin: Mrs Frank Farquarson and Mrs W.H. Marvin learned that Mary had been saved but there was no word of Daniel Marvin. When returning from picking up the RMS Titanic survivors, the rescue ship Carpathia docked, and Mrs. Daniel Marvin fainted when she learned that there was no hope for her husband to be alive. - ""He kissed me goodbye,"" stated the poor young lady, ""and I never saw him again."" Daniel died in the sinking, his body, if recovered, was never identified. Over 90 years later, Biograph has recovered and acquired the actual film images taken aboard the Titanic, believed to have been taken by Marvin.

As the stark realization takes hold of the two, they discover that there is no chance of having a family of their own. Their friends unsuccessfully try to relate to their condition and attempt to console the two, but sadly only connect in the most superficial way. They both feel they have to be strong for each other, but fear the unknown and dare not communicate their innermost fears. Nadia is cautiously optimistic toward her diagnosis but not without her own anxieties. She sees Gabriel withdraw into his newly introspective world and is concerned about his mental state. As the story unfolds, we learn of Gabriel's newly found obsession with the multi-verse theory, quantum physics, and the metaphysical, all culminate toward an unexpected reality: he discovers the ability to move freely throughout a stopped-time environment. He soon resigns himself to living almost exclusively in this isolated existence, believing that Nadia's tragic diagnosis cannot deteriorate any further. He sets out on journey to save Nadia at any cost. The Time We're In is based on my last two years coping with mom, dad, and wife all getting diagnosed with cancer.
