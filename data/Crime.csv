Gangland Undercover,42,"A gritty fact based drama series that tells the astonishing story of a drug dealer who was arrested then given a desperate ultimatum: serve over 20 years in jail, or go undercover inside one of America's most notorious biker gangs. Charles Falco opted to go undercover and for the next three years he led a crazy and dangerous life infiltrating the Vagos motorcycle gang, collecting evidence while faced with the constant risk that he might be discovered and become one of the gang's victims. Each episode unfolds a different step in Falco's covert investigation into their illegal activities, while across the series, the drama builds as carefully constructed character arcs unfold bitter personal rivalries. These tensions finally erupt when the gang's Vice President is killed in a motorcycle accident, unleashing a chain of unforeseen consequences that ultimately tear the gang apart. With suspicions about Falco's true identity mounting, the operation threatens to unravel, leading to a tense and dramatic conclusion. Drawing on the wealth of material from Falco's time under cover, along with broader documented historical research of inter gang rivalry, this series dramatically captures the reality of outlaw biker counter culture: a world where freedom is equated with the right to carry guns and trade drugs with impunity, and respect can be earned through fear... following the conclusion of his undercover operation with the Vagos, the reformed Falco goes into witness protection... but hooked on the adrenaline rush of undercover work he volunteers to go undercover inside not just one, but two more biker gangs...",2016,"Biography, Crime, Drama            ","Damon Runyan, Ian Matthews, Ari Cohen, Stephen Eric McIntyre",,3046,,8.2

Killing for Love,130,"The gruesome murders of Nancy and Derek Haysom in 1985 were an international media sensation. The Haysoms were wealthy, respected members of Virginia society, and the murder conviction of their daughter Elizabeth and her German boyfriend Jens Soering sent shock waves through the rural community of Bedford County. Elizabeth and Jens had met in a university program for high achieving students. She was a product of European boarding schools, he was the son of a diplomat. After being arrested in London, England, for passing bad checks in 1986, they were both extradited to the United States and have now spent over 30 years behind bars. This beautifully crafted film reveals a mismanaged, or perhaps completely corrupted, judicial process. This was the first criminal trial held in front of TV cameras - the first high-profile, international case tried in a small town. Investigations over the past 3 years have turned up stunning evidence that was previously suppressed or deemed inadmissible. New forensic techniques have disproven evidence that was key to Soering's original conviction. Denied parole 12 times, his next hearing in 2017 may have a different outcome, at the same time the film is in release. Unidentified fingerprints, photographic evidence that points to sexual abuse, the presiding judge's friendship with the victims, a missing FBI profile, a bloody car with a knife under the seat - all point to a very different story, one that is revealed in the film.",2016,"Documentary, Crime, Romance            ","Imogen Poots, Daniel Brühl, Jens Söring, Chuck Reid","Marcus Vetter, Karin Steinberger",1282,,7.1

After not pursuing romance for most of her adult life, Hannah Swensen, owner/operator of Hannah's Cookie Jar, a bakery/café, is being wooed by two men, who know about the other in Hannah's life. Hannah likes both a lot, but has not even kissed either. While her mother, Delores Swensen, is pushing her into the arms of dentist Norman Rhodes as the person who will provide her with a stable, comfortable life, her sister, Andrea Todd, is pushing her into the arms of Andrea's deputy sheriff husband Bill Todd's colleague, police detective Mike Kingston, as the more exciting choice. What seems to be becoming a more chronic issue in Hannah's life is that she is the person who finds someone murdered in Eden Lake, this time the victim being one of her customers, Larry Jaeger, co-owner of the Crazy Elf Christmas tree lot with his fiancée, Courtney Miller, the two who got engaged after knowing each other for only six weeks. Larry's murder is only the second such in recent memory in the town, and the second such body Hannah has discovered. Hannah can't help but get involved in the investigation, either by accident or usually more on purpose, which irks both Norman and Mike as putting her life in danger. Mike is additionally bothered that her amateur sleuthing is interfering with his official investigation. At the top of the suspect list is Delores' friend, Nancy Schmidt who is better known in town as radio talk show host on issues of the lovelorn, Dr. Love. Nancy is not Larry's ex-wife as she had implied to Delores, but rather his wife - at least up until his murder - he who she claims not to have seen in ten years as he bilked her out of her money and disappeared without a trace until now. The further Hannah and Mike investigate, the further they find that Larry was generally not a nice person who had many enemies who had motive to want to see him dead. What Hannah may or may not be aware is that she is getting closer to the truth which truly does put her life in danger as the murderer would probably not hesitate to murder a second time if she gets too close to discovering the truth.",2015,"Crime, Mystery, Romance            ","Alison Sweeney, Cameron Mathison, Barbara Niven, Lisa Durupt",Kristoffer Tabori,1068,,7.0

Set in modern day London, Two Down is nevertheless inspired by films of the 1970's, which gives this clever little thriller an interesting spin in the look, the dialogue and the sound. After surviving an explosion in Iraq, Mr. Thomas leaves the infuriating desk job the army had created for him and enters the underground world of the contract killer. His brother, Sam, had been caught selling on army secrets to the highest bidder and is now working for the illusive Harry Montagu. They use Mr. Thomas as a very effective way of eliminating problems they encounter in their business. That is until Mr. Thomas begins to question whom these problems are that he is removing, and why they deserve this fate. We start the film with Mr. Thomas following a target, a young woman. All is not as it seems as she manages to fight him off long enough for someone in the shadows to shoot him in the back. Thinking him dead they walk away, leaving him to die in the alleyway. Mr. Thomas, surviving, but injured, manages to get to a safe house owned by a friend. When he arrives however his friend is no longer there but a young woman, Sophie. Through necessity he takes her, and the local take-away delivery boy, hostage and waits for his partner to pick him up. Hours later he is still waiting and over the course of the evening, with the help of a bottle of whiskey and a Chinese take-away, they slowly unravel the events of the evening to discover that Mr. Thomas was set up. Led by a very keen Sophie they try to work out by who and why. But why is Sophie so eager to get to the bottom of the events of the evening? There is more than one mystery that Mr. Thomas has to solve, and he's quickly running out of time.

Sailing inside the pirate-infested swath of sea between Somalia and Yemen, the ship's captain blinks hard at the radar screen where a light begins to flash. This is it, Nozhkin thinks, and he's right. Machine guns sound on the boat's hull and for two months this 13-man crew will be held at the mercy of Somali pirates, helpless as hostage negotiations threaten their lives and cameras capture every move. The pirates' translator, Ishmael Ali, a single dad who may or may not have stumbled into this controversial role, puts in a call to the shipping magnate's CEO Per Gullestrup demanding an exorbitant 7 million dollars. The shipowner's response is the first of many misfires and communications to come. These two adversaries will have to become unlikely allies as they race against time in an attempt to keep the crew from being killed by their violent captors.

Uncle Sam lost it all because of his addictions to gambling, alcohol, women, and drugs. His release from rehab legally requires a halfway house, but none can take him due to his high profile. A magistrate allows his nephew Kevin Armstrong (Brian Kirk) to take him in. Kevin, 39, has idolized Sam for a lifetime, and is eager to give back to the uncle who helped shape him through his books, movies, and love.

Kevin grows disillusioned when he sees that Sam has become utterly dependent on him, to the point of emotional and financial exhaustion. Sam spends thousands of Kevin's dollars without asking, and when confronted, questions Kevin's loyalty as a nephew. Once Kevin works up the courage to cut Sam off financially, his uncle signs up for a Bank of Asia ""Vice"" card, using Kevin's name. Sam begins buying items with the card, reselling them for cash, in order to feed his drug habit and keep his gambling debt collector at bay.

The office manager at Kevin's brokerage (Lulu Braha) warned Kevin about Sam from the beginning, to no avail.

Befriend and Betray,85,"Criminal organizations succeed by enforcing a strict code of trust and loyalty. To penetrate these organizations and gain access to their inner circles the police need a magic bullet. Alex Caine is that magic bullet. Only thirty years old, Alex, who grew up hard on the mean streets of Montreal, already brings a lifetime's worth of experience (foster care, military service, prison time) to the world's most dangerous occupation: professional gang infiltrator. It is his job to befriend criminals, participate in their illegal activities, gather evidence - then live long enough to testify against them in court. Inspired by real-life events, Befriend and Betray tells the story of Alex's first infiltration assignment - the case that transformed him from a rootless young man into a highly effective, defiantly unconventional crime-fighting resource. Approached by P.C. Lau, a ruthlessly ambitious soldier for the Kam Tin Triad, Alex is asked to help his old prison acquaintance with a business proposition. Since Alex comes from Montreal and speaks French, P.C. figures he's just the man to be the face of the Kam Tin as they try to move their heroin into eastern Canada. What P.C. doesn't realize is that Alex has been approached by the police and Criminal Intelligence Services who've asked him to say ""yes"" to P.C.'s proposal - thus giving them a long sought-after way into the Kam Tin. Complicating matters for Alex is the fact that his girlfriend Melanie has no idea that he's agreed to work for the police. Alex figures that the less she knows, the safer she'll be. Trouble is, the more he lies to protect her, the more likely he is to lose the one person who sees him as more than just a valuable crime-fighting asset. Combining action, suspense, humour and actual details drawn from the case files of Alex Caine, Befriend and Betray tells the story of one man's re-birth as an infiltrator - and his struggle not to lose his identity or his life along the way.",2011,"Action, Crime, Drama            ","Tim Rozon, Byron Mann, Tom Jackson, Steph Song",Ken Girotti,105,,5.0

It is not long before Robin (Lillian Bornstein) returns to Calvin with a bold request -- she wants him to kill the man that victimized her. Reluctantly, Calvin agrees to look into the situation. Karl Screase (Eric Moyer) is a man who is as spontaneous as he is dangerous. His moral compass is shattered and as Robin puts it, ""he thrives on control and requires vengeance."" Calvin doesn't make it one day before he winds up on Karl's radar, and that's when the game begins. Karl's persistent psychological torment pushes Calvin to a moral breaking point that ends with the ultimatum: kill Robin, or Karl is going to kill him. In effect, Calvin has become the rope in a homicidal tug of war. Amidst all this, Calvin is paid a visit by his father (Corkey Ford - Platoon (1986), Born on the Fourth of July (1989)), who offers him some sage advice that resonates with Calvin through the rest of the story. Calvin resolves to withdraw from Karl and Robin's game of death, a naïve optimism that only pulls him in deeper. His attempts to walk away are met with swift brutality. Ultimately, Calvin finds that the only way back to the light is through the darkness.

Together they had a son, Anthony Brannigan Moretti. The rest of the Italian family was outraged by the ""corruption of the bloodline"" and ordered the assassination of the two and their son later on. The assassinations were successful, forcing Anthony Brannigan to flee Boston-but not first without enlisting the services of the McDoogan Brothers to seek vengeance on the Italian family's remaining leaders. Anthony left without paying the McDoogans...setting up his inheritance money in North Carolina to open a bar. 2 years later, the McDoogans find Anthony. Except now, Anthony's money has mysteriously disappeared, and the theft is blamed on the bank account manager, Steve.

BOUND: A Brutal Unflinching Glimpse Into the World of Human Trafficking,30,"Takes viewers inside a prison with no cells, where the destinies of those sentenced to servitude are bought and sold, and their jailers bear the names Addiction, Abuse, and Manipulation. This fictionalized retelling of actual events plays out through the eyes of one young victim as she tries to break free of the drug addiction and brainwashing that's been forced upon her and boldly sprints down a path that will either lead to freedom or a greater torment than she has ever known. Melissa Hanna, a newcomer to the screen but veteran of the South Carolina stage, leads the deep roster of talented actors from throughout the Carolinas and Georgia. Hanna brings amazing emotional depth to the title character, Anna Calloway, a young woman in her late teens who gets swept into the world of human sex trafficking. Merritt Vann, whose lengthy resume includes appearances in Homicide Hunter: Lt. Joe Kenda, Sleepy Hollow, Royal Pains, and Banshee, delivers a spine-chilling performance as Victor, the brutal, sly, and persuasive leader of the sex trafficking ring. The supporting cast includes powerful performances from Lindley Mayer (Glee, Dirty Dancing, Bastard out of Carolina), Chantey Colet, John Oliver, and Camila Escobar (performed with William Baldwin in the 2016 film Chronology). Writer/director Daljit Kalsi crafts an unflinching, unblinking glimpse into this dark world, which is captured masterfully through the lens of cinematographer Collins Abbott White, and assembled by editor Porter Blackman, and is all set to a chilling score composed by Neil Lee Griffin of the band Antler Hill. Kalsi warns the film will take viewers to a dark place, and hopefully with a new interest in learning more about a growing crime and ways to prevent it. ""The story is based heavily on a real account from a friend in law enforcement who was involved in a DEA investigation into human trafficking,"" Kalsi said. ""The story hit me like a ton of bricks and really made me start reading about human trafficking and its prevalence. I was shocked, and that's exactly how I hope audiences feel when the credits of this film roll - shocked, with a pit in their stomachs, and asking themselves 'could something like this be happening in my neighborhood?'"" ""It's highly disturbing material to watch and present, but if by making it we can help just one person avoid or get out of a similar situation, then it's all worth it,"" added White. The film concludes with a public service announcement from the cast members and human trafficking investigator Shannon Piller with the Greenville County Sheriff's Office, along with information and statistics from the Department of Homeland Security. ""We definitely want to touch nerves and deal a heavy emotional blow, but we hope people will also walk away wanting to make a difference and help fight this crime,"" added Vann, who is also co-producing the film with Kalsi. ""We have a terrifying true-life horror story, an incredibly talented cast and crew from all across the US, and tie it all together with real stats and warnings from law enforcement,"" Kalsi stated. ""We really feel that this film is going to impact people."" The film was funded in part with a grant from the Metropolitan Arts Council, which receives support from the City of Greenville, BMW Manufacturing Company, Michelin North America, Inc., SEW Eurodrive and the South Carolina Arts Commission.",2017,"Short, Crime, Drama            ","Merritt Vann, Lindley Mayer, Kathy Butler Sandvoss, Camila Escobar",Daljit Kalsi Jr.,0,,0.0

The film attempts to get at the story behind that conviction, which many believed resulted in a grossly unfair sentence. After having accepted that Jose has lost in court, they had hoped to fight the verdict; Jose's defense did file and lose several appeals.

The focal point is the struggle of Dr. Eloisa G. Tamez against the US Department of Homeland Security that implemented eminent domain to seize a portion of her own Lipan Apache ancestral land in El Calaboz Rancheria. This portion of the San Pedro de Carricitos Land Grant of 1786 was granted by the Spanish Crown, which began with Jose de Escandon's entrance into the area in 1745 with the settling of Nuevo Santander. Colonial records exist, which explicitly acknowledge the existence and deeded ownership of Lipan Nde' land in Texas by both Mexico and Spain, before the United States existed as an entity. The unjust seizure of their land by DHS impacts Lipan Apache cultural traditions and their very way of life, since their lives are intrinsically tied to the land and river to which they no longer have access - a clear breach of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to which the United States is a signatory.",2017,"Documentary, Crime, Family            ","Ramon Resendiz, Rosalva Resendiz",,0,,0.0

Extremely Used Cars: There Is No Hope,92,"Chip Douglas is a washed-out alcoholic car salesman at a used car lot. With the endless availability of information over the Internet, customers can now get any information about any car they want. They can find out if it's ever been in a wreck, theft recovery or water damage by means of ""CARFAX."" In addition, they can also find out a vehicle's true value by factory invoice or Kelly Blue Book, making it almost impossible to make any profit. Now, those still in the business are either trying to come up with scams to make money at it, or to get out of it entirely. While Chip is at an off-track racing bar, he happens across a drink called a Molotov Cocktail. That's when he gets the great idea of burning a bunch of cars forcing people to replace them. Chip then solicits his co-worker buddy John Harris to carry out his desperate plan. Everything works out great, or so they believe. Since all the cars that were destroyed were from their previous customers, they obviously become the prime suspects for the crime. During this time, the other salespeople are coming up with their own ways to get out of the business. Ramone Cordova is a Mexican immigrant that moved to this country so doctors could do studies on his right-hand index finger. For some unknown reason this finger continued to grow after he was fully developed and, by this point, the digit grown to nine inches long. Since he wasn't making much of a living at selling cars, he decided to keep selling them until he could become a porn star. Ramone writes his own porn screenplay that only he could star in, contributing slapstick elements to the story. The ""in-your-face"" humor is brought by the antagonist, Justin Rhoads, who is a chemically-imbalanced schizophrenic and delusional. Throughout the film, he daydreams about killing his customers and co-workers. He, in a hilarious way, will offend just about every type of person he encounters, delighting the audience when he is framed for arson and insurance fraud.",2015,"Comedy, Crime, Drama            ","Mark Donnell, Ian Reed Kesler, Aaron Kissinger, Kim Woods",Craig Richards,30,,5.9

The first variation on Hitchcock's ""The 39 Steps"" in my ""Variations on Guilt and Innocence in 39 Steps"" presents a more fitting state of things for his response to her request to come home with him, ""It's your funeral!"" and for the gleaming knife in his hand as he heads stealthily toward her in the kitchen than the one in Hitchcock's film: he uses the knife to kill his guest rather than to resume slicing bread (the gleaming knife continues not to be fully actualized in the more appropriate state of things; as the expressed, it is ""the aspect of the event that its accomplishment cannot realize""). To be radically innocent requires refraining from indulging, with ""the unbearable lightness"" of those who are unconscious of the unconscious, in ambiguous gestures, figurative speech, and the use of words whose etymology they do not take into consideration, through which they would be providing the unconscious, with its mechanisms of dissociation, condensation, etc., the opportunity of concocting a different narrative, one in which it seems that one is guilty.",2013,Crime            ,Jalal Toufic,,0,,0.0

Aarushi - Beyond Reasonable Doubt, the feature length version of a televised episodic series, reopens the 8 year long Aarushi Case Diaries. In a true-crime story, defined by compromised crime scenes, botched police investigations, extensive media trials, and a polarized India, this film pitches the prosecution against the defence, and the believers against the skeptics.

Under production for over a year and a half, the Producers of the documentary also tracked down former suspects in hiding, and reached out to international crime scene investigators and forensic scientists - a blood spatter analyst from Cambridge, a forensic pathologist from London, a former Scotland Yard deception detection analyst for their review of the evidence-on-record.",2017,"Documentary, Crime            ",Mayurica Biswas,,0,,0.0

When the shooting finally stops and the panicked screaming subsides, two men have been fatally wounded. The first: populist United States Senator Huey P. Long, the most powerful man in Louisiana, and one of the most prominent political figures in 1930s America. The second: Dr. Carl Weiss, a respected local physician, and Long's presumed assailant. Weiss is riddled with sixty bullets, some of which have passed through his body and lodged in the alabaster walls. Blood soaks through his white linen suit and onto the ornate floor of the State Capitol. Huey Long, known as ""The Kingfish,"" is rushed to the hospital, but pronounced dead thirty hours later. Louisiana politics - and the lives of the two men's families - will never be the same. Through the debate over how Huey Long was killed, 61 Bullets explores a piece of history that is as contentious as the man himself. We watch two families grasp for closure in the wake of a tragedy with ongoing political and personal ramifications. We engage those who know the most (Long experts) and those who care the most (the families of Long and Weiss) in a juxtaposition of competing narratives of the biggest political killing between McKinley and Kennedy. As the Weisses seek to rewrite history and clear their family name, the Longs strive to defend the legacy of their patriarch and preserve his iconic status.",2014,"Documentary, Crime, History            ",Huey Long,"Louisiana Kreutz, David Modigliani",9,,6.3

Drugs 101,3,"Drug 101 is a story of an African American family who tries to use the illicit drug trade to free themselves from poverty and provide a safe haven for their children. One night the foolishness of this approach comes crashing down on them and sends them into a self-destructive spiral that takes years to stop. The father, the son Chip and the baby all die on the same night. The mother begins her dependence on crack and alcohol. The remaining two sons, Jamal and Malcolm take two opposite roads...one becomes a drug dealer the other has the opportunity to take ""the road less traveled by"" and use his academic gifts to escape, but he is torn. Jamal took the blame for his thoughtless act years ago and even after being imprisoned, reaches out to save him one more time. The daughter falls in love, gets pregnant and leaves the family. Both she and Malcolm try to free the mother from the ravages of her addiction. Ultimately, the story is one of redemption. The triumph of the human spirit, the saving of a family, the healing of a community, the freeing of a people are all embodied in this story. The seed money from the All Road Grant will help to produce the beginning flashback sequence of the feature film. It is a complete short story in and of itself. It has the potential of a powerful short film on the ravages of drugs to the family and community. That is the strength of this endowment; it will help to complete the feature while providing a short film that will stand on its own while also providing a promotional opportunity for the feature. All behavior has consequences and the consequences of drugs to the African American community plays out nightly on the news. We live in the best of times for our community in that we have the best role model, an African American President of the United States. Yet we still live in the worst of times for those of us who still live in poverty, in drug infested communities seemingly separate from the promise of America. The $10,000 endowment will allow Seven Lights Productions to shine a light on a path to promise, to success, to healing that is available to all of us if we pull together to encourage the next generation.",2010,"Short, Action, Crime            ","Willie Davis III, Jordan Benjamin Williams, Lord Jamar, Rasha Mella",Jamel Wade,0,,0.0

Lions in the Night,30,"Lions in the Night An Obsessive Compulsive Love story This short film directed by Vaseem Ahmed Dehlvi stars Arjun Mathur, Geetika Tyagi, Dilip Shankar and Jyoti Sachdeva. Farhad Ahmed Dehlvi has photographed it and the Production Design is by Himani Mehta Dehlvi. 'Lions in the Night' portrays the story of an obsessive man who murders his wife because she is leaving him, and then struggles to keep this secret from his houseguest who is his former lover. The film's taut screenplay deftly maneuvers the audiences through half an hour of myriad basic emotions- love, obsession, murder, romance, sex, revenge and deceit. The story unfolds from the killers point of view and even though the murder takes place in the first few minutes, the audience slowly begins to empathize with the killer rather than his forced house guest -- his ex girlfriend. 'Lions in the Night' teases and tantalizes with its clever sleight of hand and its misdirection keeps the viewers engaged. There is a heightened sense of reality maintained throughout the film by interplays of silence and actual sounds. The deliberate absence of music enhances the tension and the suspense. The forced interaction of two characters in a confined space of two days keeps the drama pure and intense as the story moves towards an explosive and surprising climax. This stark noir piece unravels the dark layers of repressed primal emotions in society that burst forth in a violent fury and a brutal display of obsessive violence.",2011,"Short, Crime, Drama            ","Abhinava Bhattacharya, Nomita Dasgupta, Vaseem Ahmed Dehlvi, Arjun Mathur",Vaseem Ahmed Dehlvi,0,,0.0

The Wind Blows East,10,"This is my first effort in directing a film. I had an idea about twenty dollars traveling between three types of people; a Homeless Man, a Hooker and a Thief. All survivors of the streets. I chose these types of people because I find that these types of people will do anything to get money. One will kill, one sells her body for a night, and the other will beg for it unashamedly. It is a hard world for these people and I wanted to show a glimpse of their lives. I don't think we caught enough of it in this short, no-dialogue piece and that's why I plan to turn it into a feature. I had written a feature-length script revolving around the same central idea but I don't have the budget yet to make my vision come true. Everything we did was for free and without permits. It was a wonderful cast and crew and they were as helpful as any director could ask for.
