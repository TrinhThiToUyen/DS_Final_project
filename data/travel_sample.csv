The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head, and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another,
You'll regret it all one day

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
Please don't take my sunshine away",travel
2,QZod5vAli7g,,"Traveling alone to Machu Picchu never thought was possible. I found out about this wonder of the world when I was studying at my University. I was so fascinated about the story behind it that I told myself jokingly that I will go there one day. Little did I know that It will really happen! 

I started in Lima, Peru then took a plane to Cusco (Cuzco) There is also a bus going to Cusco which is cheaper but of course, it will take a long time to get there. You can do the Inka trail to get to Machu Picchu from Cusco but as for me, since I only have a limited time traveling, I decided to take the bus and Inka rail even if it's more expensive. I stayed in Aguas Caliente for a night and went to see Machu Picchu in the morning. I hired a private tour guide since I know I will be taking a lot of photos and videos for my content. I guess that's the only downside when I travel, is that I have to work while traveling but I am not complaining at all! I love what I do and I owe it all to you, my subscribers and viewers.


Life can be so crazy! I promise to travel the world and share with you guys my experiences and continue to create meaningful content for you to enjoy with your friends and family. I hope that I get to inspire you to see the world while you're young and healthy, to reach for that dream no matter how big you think it is or scary to achieve it! Never let anyone tell you you can't do it because you can!!!

Thank you to Skillshare for sponsoring this video! 

Yep, I travelled to what the internet deems the least visited country in the world. The reality is that the statistics behind this are far from perfect. Many of these small countries don't actually count how many people come visit. So it's very hard to really tell which country truly has the least visitors. Either way, I went to Tuvalu, which is somewhere in the bottom of the list... and my experience was shocking.

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let’s start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan’s capital, and home to the world’s largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn’t disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world’s biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you’ll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. 

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I’ve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it’s big, it’s busy and it’s brilliant. As ever, let’s start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you’ll come into one of Tokyo’s two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don’t need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you’ve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you’ve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here’s what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you’re being dropped off. There’s also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport’s dedicated monorail. It’ll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. 

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That’s Haneda! Here’s what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It’ll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you’re flight’s on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there’s a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",travel

It includes my top things to do and places to visit in Bali and is based on my travel to Bali during the summer of 2017. I spent roughly two weeks on the island visiting Ubud, the Gili Islands, and Seminyak. 

I tried to add as much helpful information as I could, which I hope provides a good idea on how to travel Bali or at least serve as a form of inspiration.

25,ka-ZgwCXK,Venice Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The Italian city of Venice is a city like no other, rising from the waters of Venice Lagoon. Follow us through the historic streets – and canals – and see why Venice should be firmly on your bucket list!

When ready, browse vacation packages to Venice: 

Begin your   in the central district of San Marco. Journey along one of the world’s great aquatic thoroughfares, The Grand Canal. Glide past elegant palazzos; today many of these palaces house important museums and galleries. 
 
Known as The City Of Bridges, Venice has hundreds to discover. The Accademia Bridge offers some of the Grand Canal’s finest views. The oldest of the Grand Canal’s four crossings is the Rialto Bridge, which serves as the gateway to the Rialto Markets. The most famous of all is the Bridge of Sighs, which connects Doge’s Palace to the historic prison.
 
Venice is a city to get lost in, so put away your map and let her surprise you. Just remember, this city smiles upon those who linger. So stay for a few nights, or  for a month, and savor every moment she has to offer.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this   as much as we enjoyed making it.

Modernity and antiquity collide in this vibrant city.

50,F36m3Bs8U,,"Today I take a look at the Lance travel Trailer 2465 and look at the difference in quality you can see. I don't often see used Lance travel trailers for sale which makes me think people hold on to them for a long time. I do have to say there is a difference in quality you can see as you go through them but the question you have to ask is does it fit what you need and does it fit the budget. Is the increased quality enough to justify the increase in price?

52,kPWT6rz2z2M,PAKISTAN- 10 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE TRAVELLING TO PAKISTAN!,"After backpacking Pakistan, here are 10 Pakistan travel tips and things I wish I knew before visiting to Pakistan to help me plan my trip, reassure me and have the best time in this amazing country!

1- Pakistan is Safe! Some areas of Pakistan are not possible to visit as a tourist but many are and these are the places you will want to go as a tourist in Pakistan!

2- The People of Pakistan! The people in Pakistan are truly amazing and so hospitable, I really urge you to speak to locals. However there is a difference between hospitality and getting free things in Pakistan

3- Female Safety in Pakistan. I didn't travel Pakistan as a solo female but I came away from Pakistan knowing that I will visit again on my own. I have made a separate video on female travel in Pakistan here: 

4- Visa for Pakistan. There are 50 countries who can get a visa on arrival in Pakistan. The rest need to apply for an e-visa for Pakistan and need a letter of invitation or proof of hotel bookings for the whole stay. The visa process for Pakistan is changing a lot so stay updated by looking on the official website: 

5- Weather in Pakistan. Pakistan is an all year round destination but you cannot visit all of Pakistan all year round. It's best to visit Northern Pakistan in the Summer however places in Southern Pakistan in the summer will be hot and wet. In the winter the South is best to visit but the North will be covered in snow.

6- Getting Around Pakistan. There is lots of transport in Pakistan and I found it pretty easy to use. There are regular buses between Lahore and Islamabad and you can fly from Islamabad to Skardu and Hunza, although these flights can often be delayed. Trains are another way of getting between the cities like Karachi and Lahore and in cities and towns we caught taxi's really easily and used Uber in Lahore and Islamabad which was reliable. 

7- How Much Time to See Pakistan. Most visa's for Pakistan and for 1 month and if you can, I recommend spending one month in Pakistan! However 2 or 3 weeks in Pakistan is also a good amount of time.

8- Internet in Pakistan. It's fairly easy to get Zong and Jazz sim cards which work in places like Lahore and Islamabad but in the Northern areas of Pakistan you need Scom or Telstra and even then data is limited. I found the wifi to not be great up North and many hotels were not advertised online so the best way is to disconnect and book things when you arrive.

9 - Cash & ATM's in Pakistan. I recommend foreigners to Pakistan to bring bring a few bank cards because I found that not all foreign bank cards work in all banks and for example, Islamabad airport doesn’t have an ATM that works for international cards right now so try to bring cash for taxi if landing there. Many places will not take card and so cash is needed.

10- Pakistan is changing a lot! So you should go there soon whilst it's still relatively unvisited but easy to visit too!

Apple Cider Vinegar | Best Reasons to Never Travel without it - Thomas DeLauer

So you know how when you travel, you always end up gaining a little bit of weight or you just get inflamed and you hold a bunch of water weight, your face feels puffy, your abdomen feels puffy, you just don't look as good as you did when you left. It's like, ""Okay, I'm going on vacation and now all of a sudden I look like garbage. What the heck is going on?""

So anyhow, let's go ahead and let's break it all down.

Let's go ahead and let's dive into the science. Okay, the first thing that we have to look at is our gut bacteria. So you may not know this, but our gut bacteria differs from day to night, and this has been proven in multiple studies, but in particular, we found with my studies that when mice go from day to night, they can have a 15% variance just in their overall gut bacteria.

There was a study that was published in the Journal Cell, took a look at a couple of people that were traveling from the USA to Israel, this was really wild. So they went across time zones. Well, they measured their gut bacteria before they left and then when they landed. They found after they landed and crossed time zones that their levels of Firmicutes bacteria or exceptionally higher.



So if we look at some stuff that Dr. Lawrence Brandt in New York did, he talked about how when we travel, it's like this digestive process that occurs. It's like a balloon. So if you have a balloon and you fill it with gas, and that balloon goes up into the atmosphere, the pressure from the atmosphere is going to trigger sort of the expansion of the gas inside the balloon, causing some bloating. Well imagine that happening to the human body, we have some gas in our abdomen that's naturally there, and then we go up into any kind of pressurized system, we're just still at a relative altitude of maybe five to 7,000 feet on an airplane. Well, what's going to happen is that's going to trigger the expansion of gases in our gut, which means now there's more room for things to move around and it changes the colonization of bacteria, but it also changes how food ferments, which therefore can make a big difference.



Well, this is where apple cider vinegar comes in. You see, one thing that we have to pay attention to is hydrochloric acid levels. When we get dehydrated or when we're traveling, perhaps our hydrochloric acid levels, which is what breaks down food in our gut, end up getting thrown out of whack. Well, and what happens when our hydrochloric acid levels get lower is it makes it so that the food that is in our system stays in one spot longer because it's not able to get digested and it ferments

Now, the other thing we have to look at is the activity of pepsin. Apple cider vinegar increases the activity of pepsin, which means you're able to absorb and utilize nutrients better, less sitting in your gut and more actually getting into your bloodstream and actually working.




And then there was a study that was published in scientific reports that found that apple cider vinegar kills off certain bacteria. So for example, in this case they found that it kills E.coli.




So what you would want to do is take a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with possibly a little bit of turmeric, a little bit of black pepper so it helps the absorption, and just take a little shot of that sucker before you get on the plane. And it can help you out immensely.




Pectin as a Prebiotic:




So as always, please keep it locked in here on my channel and I'll see you in the next video.",travel

60,82suLsvc-oY,,"If you travel by plane quite a lot, dozens of questions can be accumulated in your brain. For example, what are the best shoes to wear at the airport security screening to not be asked to take them off? Or are those scanners you have to go through harmful to your health? Or how long the things seized during the pre-flight inspection can be stored at the airport for?  

You’d definitely like to know how to cancel non-refundable tickets and get your money back or how to significantly reduce the costs for transfers, hotels, and food even if it’s your first trip and you don’t have any discount cards. So here's the list of advice you should heed before your next trip. 

TIMESTAMPS:
Seized things 
The radiation you get during the flight 
How not to spill your coffee 
What if they don't feed you 
Buying liquids in Duty-Free 
Pay in dollars or euros 
Avoid carrying spray deodorants 
Have a pair of extra underwear in your carry-on 
What you can do if you need coins 
Innocent things that may be prohibited 
Where you can find unoccupied toilets 
Put a couple of tennis balls in your carry-on 
What if the airline's site just doesn't work 
How to entertain yourself at the airport 
Make sure your socks don't have holes in them 
What if your first flight gets delayed 
How to save some money 

  

SUMMARY:
- You shouldn't be wary of airport scanners - they don't harm your health.
- If you have some powder in your baggage, be it some baby formula, flour, or instant drinks, keep it in its original packaging. 
-  At some airports, you can buy drinking water right after you pass the security check.
- Check if the airport or airline sells 24-hour access to a VIP lounge zone. In most cases, you can have free snacks and drinks there.
- While in the baggage claim area, you might have to pay for Wi-Fi; but in the arrival zone, it's almost always free.
-  If you’re in the middle of a bad cold, but you absolutely have to fly, take a painkiller before the plane takes off and lands.
- You can’t keep power banks in your checked baggage. 
- When going on a trip, instead of taking the whole perfume bottle, take a tester. 
-  If you have a brand-new unopened bottle of nail polish in your carry-on, it's ok. But if you've already used it, put it in your checked luggage.
- . Seemingly innocent things like plants, seeds, and some types of food may be prohibited if you're flying to Australia, or other particular islands.
- You're more likely to find unoccupied toilets in the baggage claim area, near customs, next to big cafes, and in waiting lounges. 
- While packing for a long flight, remember to put a couple of tennis balls in your carry-on. If you roll your feet on them during the flight, your legs and feet won't swell up.  
- Statistically, the safest seats are in the tail of the aircraft.
-  If you're traveling through several time zones, try to do more physical activity the day before. 
- If there are lots of empty seats on a plane, and you have the airline's bonus card, you can ask the flight attendants to move you to business class. 
- You can still pay for your onboard purchases with your bank card, even if there's no Internet on the plane. In this case, the money will be withdrawn as soon as you land.

HAPPY PAKISTAN INDEPENDENCE DAY !!! 

So, this ISN'T  my BIG Pakistan video... I'm still working on that- Sorry !!! This was just something special I put together especially for Pakistan Day, to show my appreciation for the country, and not only to share to the world what Pakistan is truly about, but- to inspire Pakistanis to look at their own country differently, and to also treat their own people with higher respect. We are all human, we all deserve love, and these amazing people I met here are beautiful models of humanity. The love and energy you put out is what you will receive! I hope that these precious moments inspire you all to live a more deeper,passion and love filled life.

75,dnVVxJoVbGM,Bad Travel Day - Autism On An Airplane,"It was a bad travel day...it just wasn't a good day in general. This was one of those situations as a parent and as an autism parent that we just wanted to throw in the towel and start over but we couldn't. We managed to keep smiling but by the time we got in the car to go home we were just done. Autism on an airplane can be so hard for everyone because of the sensory issues, the anxiety, and the challenges it presents. Without a doubt it is hardest on Abbie and that's what really breaks our hearts. On the good side of it all...the world is a far more accepting and understanding place than you might assume.

Over the past few years I've found myself averaging anywhere from 2-4 flights a month. That's more than the typical American. I am lucky that I get to create my own schedule, and skip off to a new adventure whenever I please- here are the 10 travel mistakes that I've made so that you are aware of them and don't make them. Some of these are rookie travel mistakes that may seem obvious, and some of these are more personal to my perspective on traveling and how to have a fulfilling trip.

My Millennial Life Crisis was started 3 years ago when I was stuck in a rut creatively, career wise, and personally. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I wasn't happy with where I was living, and I didn't feel like I had much of a support system. That is how the Millennial Life Crisis series was born. It was a way for me to let go of my feelings and document my personal growth. Along the way I have found that a lot of you have related with this feeling, that is why I keep vlogging. From now on you can expect weekly Millennial Life Crisis episodes about my life, growing up, career growth, trying new things, friendships, relationships, family, and travels.",travel

When ready, browse vacation packages to Bolivia:  

A  to , a landlocked South American country, holds the promise of discovery for adventurous souls. While pretty Sucre is Bolivia’s judicial capital, La Paz is its political capital and also its main tourist hub.

Journey high to the Mirador Laikacota for city views. Deep in the valley below  the central Plaza Murillo, home to the most precious buildings: the Presidential Palace, National Congress and Metropolitan Cathedral. Stay near the Plaza San Francisco for its proximity to hidden gems, such as the curious Witches’ Market, the Musical Instrument Museum and the Coca Museum.

Bolivia is a diamond in the rough; relatively undeveloped, but extremely authentic, colorful and cultural. Bolivia’s riches shine through in the country’s high altiplanos, its floating reed islands on Lake Titicaca, the silver mines of Potosi, the infinite salt flats of the Salar de Uyuni and the untamed tropical lowlands in the vast Amazon basin.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this   as much as we enjoyed making it.

— About Exploring Colombia —
Colombia, a country which many only know because of it’s violent past, has been on my list since I went to South America for my first long-term trip in 2012. 6 Years later and with 5 weeks to spend it was finally time to properly explore my country number 9 on the continent. 
For the first part of the trip I’ll be traveling with my mate David to the historical city of Cartagena, some picturesque Carribean islands and to the city of Medellin where we get to learn about the violent past and the transformation of the country. After a few days in the capital Bogota I’ll be joined by my good friend Stefan to learn salsa and take on some outdoor adventures in Cali before heading up to Santa Marta where we checkout the most beautiful beaches, float down rivers and hike through the mountains.

In  the Brazilian locals pile onto the beautiful beaches and express themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. 

Any Rio de Janeiro  must make a stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city’s iconic peak, and try not to look down – it’s a long way to the ground!

After a morning spent in nature, your  should continue back in the city. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. 

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this   as much as we enjoyed making it.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation. He is the author of several popular books and is a host of a great podcast called Mindscape.

Looking for the best things to do in Quebec City? Click play on our travel guide to get an insider’s peek at this Canadian destination. 

You don’t need to go all the way to France to say “Bonjour” and nibble on croissants. Quebec maintains strong ties to its French roots, which date back to 1608. In fact, the town’s official language is French and it’s even home to a replica of Norte Dame. 

While you’re in town, mosey around the cafes and shops in North America’s oldest retail district, and visit the Musee de la Civilisation. Embark on Quebec City tours around the colonial buildings in Dufferin Terrace, the history at Battlefields Park, and the stunning beauty of Montmorency Falls. From the Saint Lawrence River to Fontaine de Tourny, there are endless attractions to experience in Quebec’s capital city.  

When you’re looking to indulge in a little European flair, without leaving North America, explore Quebec City. To further fuel your adventures, check out our travel guide video and pick up more tips and recommendations.

121,6A7S4bkrgmQ,Everything Shay Mitchell Packs in Her Travel Bag | Little Black Book | Harper's BAZAAR,"Shay Mitchell's life is all about finding balance on the road–be it planning her outfits with her go-to stylist, Monica Rose, or taking care of her skin after long leg trips and multiple flights with facialist Shani Darden. But if there's one thing Mitchell knows best after spending more of her life traveling than she does at home, it's how to pack.

""My parents were avid travelers and through them, I truly caught the travel bug,"" Mitchell shares with BAZAAR. Her desire to always be comfortable, prepared, and looking refreshed while on the road–which she says makes up about 75% of her year–encouraged her to start her new luggage and travel accessories line, BEIS, full of ""fun, functional, chic, and affordable,"" options for weekenders, totes, makeup bags, suitcases, luggage tags, garment and laundry bags, and more. 

Mitchell's love of travel and all her business trips have made her the expert her friends turn to when prepping for a vacation–and she shared all those tips and tricks in the third and final installment of her .

122,iXGtx-hroKE,Working online and traveling the world - digital nomads | DW Documentary,"Working online whilst traveling the world sounds like a dream job for many people. But what exactly is a digital nomad? Pete and Supi live as digital nomads.

They travel the world permanently, work on the road and are always online. Their lives epitomize the digital revolution and how it is changing how we work live.

Many people dream of living and working on the road - a dream that has come true for Pete and Supi. Driven by a passion for travel, they set out to escape the dreary routine of everyday life. They want to achieve maximum self-fulfilment without big safety nets and full-cover insurance, in a nomadic world of adventure. Pete is a DJ, so parties and big cities are a defining part of his life, whereas Suparni aka Supi is the opposite; she’s looking for spirituality and awareness. The two show us the huge spectrum of opportunities that the world of the digital nomad has to offer. Despite their fundamental differences, they both earn their living by working remotely. The digital age has made this way of life possible: without the Internet, it would be almost unthinkable. But their lifestyle does have its limits, as is becoming especially evident to Suparni with her plans for parenthood. But it's hard to find someone you love who also loves the same sort of lifestyle, and the constant travel is a big obstacle.

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video:  and this one: 

Q How do you work together with brands?

125,KtRsk4Bjs9,Perth Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Perth.d180013...

A modern city, Perth is the gem of Australia’s west coast and the capital of Western Australia. This friendly metropolis boasts pristine beaches, clear water, and plenty of coastline – not to mention an abundance of nature and mineral resources.

Start your day of Perth sightseeing with a walk through Kings Park, which is larger than New York’s Central Park and home to the Western Australia Botanic Garden. More than 3,000 species of Western Australia’s plant life, including vibrant flowers, are on display here. Most of the park consists of bushland, which means lots of wildlife and quite a few walking trails.

After a morning of reflection in the park, head over to the Swan Bell Tower to enjoy a spectacular view of the city. Don’t forget your camera! You will notice the diverse nature of Perth’s architecture from this vantage point, including the modern glass structures and London-inspired Tudor buildings. 

Perth tours are never complete without a ferry ride to Rottnest Island, affectionately called “Rotto” by the locals. This getaway is rife with opportunities to snorkel in the Indian Ocean, see wildlife such as seals and birds, and travel across more than 31 miles of cycle ways on a rented bicycle.

Once your feet are back on mainland Western Australia, visit one of the jewels, and ultimately what draws much of the Perth tourism: Swan Valley. This region has a landscape peppered with vineyards, no surprise given that growing grapes has been a long-standing tradition in Swan Valley. Following a short (or leisurely paced) day trip to Swan Valley, return to Perth and head to Hillarys Boat Harbour for a sunset dinner. 

What will you do in Perth?

129,LcKnx7I97yk,Dublin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Despite a long and sometimes tragic history of invasion and resistance, this thriving business capital has poetry, music and literature percolating through its cobblestones.

Dubliner, Oscar Wilde once said “life is too important to be taken seriously.” While Dublin proudly honours its past, it is equally passionate about enjoying each and every new day. Nowhere is life celebrated more than in the city’s nearly 700 pubs. Nothing matters more to Dubliners than having a good time or, as locals call it, the craic.

Of all the gifts, Dublin has given to the world, perhaps the most intoxicating are its stories. Originally built for the sons of the Irish gentry, the ivy-covered stone buildings of Trinity College are home to some of the oldest remaining manuscripts in the world, including the 1000-year-old Book of Kells.

Dubliner Jonathan Swift, once said, “May you live all the days of your life.” There is no better way to define Dublin. Its passion for life is contagious, captivating and sure to stay with you for the rest of your days.

131,x-G5wbAoXSA,Must Know Vietnam Travel Tips to Danang & Hoi An | Vietnam Series Ep. 1,"Vietnam Da Nang and Hoi An Travel Guide and Travel Tips that you must know before you go.  This Vietnam Travel Guide is part of my Vietnam series and we start episode 1 with things you need to know before you go to Danang as well as things you need to know before you go to Hoi An Vietnam.  Da Nang Beach and the Danang Beach resorts are popular destinations and I will help you navigate through the city and give you my favorite tips and tricks.  My Da Nang travel tips are based on what I wish I knew before coming to Da Nang Vietnam as well as Hoi An Vietnam.  There are many things to do in Da Nang but I wanted to focus on the differences of each area, what each specific area offers and general things you must know when coming to danang for the first time.  In fact, Da nang is the fifth largest city in Vietnam and located central part of the country.  IT is locate don the cost of the South China Sea and is one of the most important ports in Vietnam.

There are more seafood restaurants options by the Da Nang beach area, like the ones where you get to pick out the live seafood from tanks or buckets and then staff will weigh it out in front of you.  I personally enjoy this process andI think it’s more reasonably priced.  So if you’re like me, this beachside may be your best choice

This Da Nang Vietnam Guide is the first episode of my Vietnam series.  I will be covering Da Nang Vietnamese Street Food, Luxury Hotel and Beach Resorts, Vietnamese Airlines and much more.

132,Qu7NZ1rC1O,Liechtenstein (Europe) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Liechtenstein in Europe.
In the middle of the triangular border of Germany, Austria and Switzerland lies a treasure of the European Alps, the Principality of Liechtenstein.  Hardly anywhere else in Central Europe has experienced such a rapid transformation from a dreamy agrarian state into one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Bendern, part of the village of Gamprin, is one of eleven municipalities and lies to the south-west side of the Eschner Mountain.  The view glides across the foothills of the romantic Rhine Valley and up to the massive Swiss Schwäg-Alp. The Schaedler ceramics workshop in Nendeln is one of the oldest commercial enterprises in Liechtenstein and features handmade works of art.  Since 1836, they have specialised in earthenware, exclusive ceramic art and tilted stoves. Schaan forms the border to the Oberland, a charming municipality with an attractive town centre.  A parish hall and provision of good restaurants reflect the success of the global companies that are located there. Liechtenstein Castle looms majestically above Vaduz, the capital.  Saint Florin is located on the edge of the old town it was built in 1868 in Neo-Gothic style and in 1997 officially dedicated as a cathedral.  From the Sareiser Joch there are several trails along the ridge such as the Princess Gina Route that traverses various mountains of the border triangle.  More than four hundred well marked hiking trails are offered throughout Liechtenstein, plus a hundred and sixty kilometres in the Alps. The Principality is a treasure trove of both landscape and culture with mountains, pastures, castles, fortresses and museums.  But Liechtenstein has also become a small, modern state with a vital and indelible focus on finance and industry, a tiny paradise that is also an important economic power.

Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
New Zealand has a lot to offer even the most particular traveller. From the lively neighbourhoods of Wellington to the breathtaking Fiordland of the South Island, there's an adventure tucked away in every corner of this impressive country. Consider living out your own Lord of the Rings adventure in Hobbiton, or hike past Mt. Doom in Tongariro National Park. Not thrilling enough? Then skydive over Auckland, go white water rafting down Kaituna River or take a leap of faith and bungee jump in Queenstown! When you're in New Zealand, nearly ever adventure is only a stone's throw away. 

Make the most out of your visit to this remote island nation by assembling your bucket list with our travel guide. Booking a tour will ensure your trip is fun, flawless and stress-free: 


New Zealand boasts a temperate climate with plenty of sunshine and moderate rainfall. Because of the long coast line, you can expect mild temperatures for the most part. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year. Remember to pack your waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain jacket, swimsuit, flip flops, thin gloves, hiking socks, sunglasses, and a camera with extra batteries. 

New Zealand's currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZ$). You should expect to be able to switch between cash and cards quite seamlessly, as all major credit cards can be used in New Zealand. Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.

We'd like to thank New Zealand's incredible tourism board for allowing use of their travel footage: 

---About New Zealand---

New Zealand, exists on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and is home to over 4.6 million people, and nearly 30 million sheep. 

The country is divided into two portions: the North and South Islands separated by the Cook Strait. The North Island is home to many hot springs and geysers while the South Island is mountainous, forested and covered in glaciers. Over 75% of New Zealanders call the North Island home, and more than 15% of New Zealand's energy comes from renewable resources.

NYC consists of 5 Boroughs, Manhattan, the most famous and dense is also the smallest. Brooklyn is the most populated, with 2.6 million residents (total of 8.5M in NYC). Queens is the largest, and “most ethnically diverse” county in the US.  Bronx is the northenmost and the only one that is part of the US Mainland. Staten Island is the most suburban

Manhattan is BIG -- don’t expect to walk the whole thing in a day
5 days is probably the sweet spot.  No less than 3 days.

 Wear comfortable shoes
 Girls:   Sex and the City says everybody walks in heels all the time -- not so much.
 Don’t try and walk everywhere, the subway is there for a reason.

 NYC is Expensive!  Everything costs more here.
 The city runs on tips

 New Yorkers aren’t really rude.. They are just efficient.

 Expect to pay to use a bathroom, there really aren’t many good public toilets
 
Weather
 For about 8 months out of the year it is chilly. And, for about 3 months it’s just plain miserable.  Be prepared for really cold and windy, or really hot, humid, and muggy.  Be prepared to rain always.
 
 Summer: Highs 84F/29C Lows: 68F/20C (July)
 Winter: Highs: 38F/3C  -  Lows  25F/-4C (January)

 Winter Footwear -- puddles the size of small lakes
 Layers
 
Best months:   September, October, May and June

Getting in

 Airports
  LaGuardia (M80 Bus)
  JFK (Airtrain to Howard Beach then catch the subway)
  Newark (30 mins on Amtrak or NJ Transit)
 Beware of unnoficial cabs

 Trains -- to Penn Station or Grand Central.  Grand Central is amazing.
 Megabus if you’re on the east coast
 Driving -- if you do drive in… just plan to park and leave your car for the duration of your stay.

Transportation in NYC

The Subway mostly runs north south… east and west you’ll be walking it
 If you’re in NYC for awhile, get a week or month long Subway pass
 Avoid the empty subway car, it’s empty for a reason.  Hot or smelly.
 Don’t lean on the subway poles… more people can hold on to it
 Pay attention to the local, or express trains.
 Get in the subway at the correct entrance, going the right direction, and for the right line

 There are tons of yellow taxis… but they are notoriously hard to hail in bad weather
 Flagship city for Uber, Lyft.  But traffic is slow.
 If you’re running late, don’t take a taxi.  You WILL get stuck in traffic.

 Walking -- don’t drop in the middle of the sidewalk

 Ferrys for a different way to get around
   NYC Ferry - East River route for some of the best views

 Citi Bikes -- 10,000 bikes and 600 stations -- Download the citi bike app - $12/day
 Bus Tours -- skip it

Times Square

 Crowded, chaotic, dazzling and overpriced 
 Is really small -- and there’s not much to do once you get there.
 Whatever you do, don’t eat here.  The food is overpriced and mediocre due to high rent.

Broadway Shows
 Book way ahead of time
 There’s a vibrant “Off-Broadway” Scene
 Book of Mormon and Avenue Q are my favorites
 Check out the TKTs booth for cheap tickets or online now

Parks (Central Park & the High Line)
 Central Park Is really big -- and no subway across
 Central Park is 800 Acres
 Strawberry Fields, Sheep’s Meadow, ice skating rinks.
 Visit the High Line on a weekday to avoid the crowds

Big Apple Attractions
 Statue of Liberty -- book ahead of time
 Cant get tix for the Statue of Liberty, ride the Staten Island Ferry for free!
 Empire State Building -- Long Lines
 Top of the Rock is really cool -- great views of the Empire State
 New WTC Observatory
9/11 Memorial ($2 Reservation Fee
 Museum of Modern Art 
Metropolitan Museum of Art
American Museum of Natural History (Suggested Admission)
Chelsea Market
New York Public Library
Flatiron Building
Shopping along 5th Avenue

Hotels
 Expensive!
 Save some money by staying in Queens, Brooklyn, or Staten Island
 If money is no object -- the Park Hyatt is amazing
 Marriott Marquis on Times Square in the middle of it all

Food
 Food carts and trucks can be really good
 The Halal Guys is a “must eat”
 Grimaldi’s Pizza (In Brooklyn under the bridge) and Lomardis in Little Italy
 Pastrami on Rye
 Shake Shack started here
 Chinatown Get noodles at Xi’an Famous Foods (location in Chinatown)
 Bagels with Lox
 New York Hotdogs from Gray’s Papaya
 New York Cheesecake

140,EwZHqva8U,28 CRAZY SMART TRAVEL HACKS,"TRAVEL HACKS YOU NEED TO KNOW

We are ready to help to make your travel more comfortable. Follow our tips and you will know the best travel tips that will ease your life. One of the biggest problems usually is how to pack a suitcase and to effectively use space. The first step in packing like a pro is to roll clothes instead of folding. Roll clothes in small tubes and will save a ton of space and prevent wrinkles. Moreover, you will find helpful tips on how to make your flight as comfortable as possible. You don’t need to buy a pricey suitcase cover, use an old t-shirt. Moreover, It’s very important to save money during traveling. A lot of travelers save their money by sewing their own protective pocket inside of shorts or pants. Besides, you can use a soap bar, hairbrush, empty lipstick container, phone case to hide money. Store your phone and money safely in an empty sunscreen bottle while relaxing on the beach. Clean and dry the bottle and put your things inside. 
Check out beach life hacks that will make a vacation even better:
-    Mesh laundry basket could be used to store sand-free the beach stuff
-    Use pop tab to repair broken flip flops
-    Check out how to make a summer tattoo using sunscreen
-    Put your phone in a ziplock bag to protect it from sand and water
-    One of the worst parts of summer is getting a sunburn. When it happened to throw some aloe vera gel into ice cube trays and freeze it

 In addition, you will find awesome camping hacks that will make your stay in the wild more comfortable. Use stones to dry wet shoes while camping. Warm up stones in a fire and put into the shoes. Make a portable washing machine out of a bucket. Cut a plastic bottle and make an emergency spoon if you forgot the real one 😊

Samuel Tisherman at the University of Maryland School of Medicine brings a man back from the dead as a breakthrough way of performing emergency surgery. But can this medical procedure finally make deep space travel possible? Your seven years journey to another planet might be less boring if you're ""dead"" for most of the trip.

Wished we spent more time in Morocco but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay while it lasted, especially the wonderful people, riads and scenery.

148,J0AHqn_bG_E,Las Vegas Travel Tips: 10 Things to Know Before You Go to Las Vegas,"Things YOU need to know before you travel to Las Vegas Nevada.  Las Vegas is Big, so is the Strip. Things are much further away than they seem from looking on a map. it will take you at least a 15-30 minute walk to get to a different hotel than your own. The Las Vegas strip is 4 miles. Find the shortcuts between hotels (Bally’s to Paris). Bring Comfortable Footwear. Leave the 4 inch heels at home, or have a second pair. Use the free trams (Luxor to Excalibur) (Monte Carlo to Bellagio). The monorail is pretty convenient too. Don’t try to hail Taxis on the strip, they won’t stop, it’s illegal. Go to a hotel taxi stand to get a taxi, be prepared to wait in line. And traffic at 6pm is awful

2. Downtown Las Vegas
 Is really far.  $30 cab ride
 But the Freemont Street Experience is cool
 And it’s neat to see “old” vegas
 People say the best slot machine odds are downtown (worst at the airport)

3. Hotels
 Don’t pick the cheapest hotels… You’ll regret that $25/night rate.
 If you want to be in the “middle” stay around Caesars Palace
 Resort fees… ugh!
 Many strip hotels are charging for parking, loyalty program might get it for free
 If you like “peace and quiet” pick a non-casino hotel.  I usually stay at Marriott properties a block or two off the strip, no resort or parking fees.

4. Gambling
 Learn the games, lots of free classes at Casinos
Join the Player’s Clubs
 Lots of free perks
 Front of line, free parking, discounts on shows, food, etc

5. It’s the desert
 Drink plenty of water, it’s dry all the time
 Buy the water at a supermarket. Can be $6 a bottle at the casino
 In the summer its really hot! 
 Wear suncreen
 In the winter it can be really cold and windy!  Bring a jacket Nov-Feb.
 The casinos are always super cold… so bring a light jacket or sweater even in summer

6. When to go?
 When there isn’t a convention in town… check the convention calendars
 Mid-week and Christmas is also a slow time
 Vegas doesn’t close… ever it’s 24/7

7. Food
Is awesome
Do some research before you go -- there are lots of good restaurants, but they aren’t the obvious ones
For example, Bouchon is hidden up some random elevator in the Venetian
If there’s a famous restaurant somewhere else in the world that you’ve wanted to eat at, it might very well have a location in Vegas
For Example HofBrauHaus from Munich
Can be expensive
But can be cheap.  You can still find a T-bone steak for $4.95
Cheapest is usually downtown
Chinatown has good eats too
 Breakfast is available 24/7

7.1. Buffets are great, 
But just once a day
 Twice a day is overdoing it!
 The time at the end of lunch right before dinner is the best deal
 IF you time it perfectly with the line
 But the lines can be LONG, think hours, 1, 2, 3 hours even.
 Eat dinner at 5pm or 8:30pm to avoid the rush.

7.2. You can drink alcohol anywhere
 Leaving a hotel?  Ask for a to-go cup and drink on the sidewalk

8. ATMs are super expensive
 Standard Vegas ATM fee is like $6
 Bring Cash
 Bank ATMS are hard to find

9. Smoking
 Seems to be allowed everywhere
larger megaresorts have higher ceilings and good filtration systems, 
but the smaller, older casinos can get quite smoky.

10. Tipping
 Everybody wants a tip in Vegas
 15-20% for restaurants
 Costumed people on the streets want money for photos

Common Questions:

Do your kids go to school?........Yes, they are homeschooled with the help of an online curriculum, based on standards in the US. Amy is their teacher and the boys report it is twice as challenging as when they were in public school. Additionally, let's not forget the education they receive why we are traveling. Most will agree there is no substitute for this type of education.

What are your names?..... Ronnie, Amy, A-man (Ayden) and B-man (Bastian) 

Where are you from? St Louis, Mo USA

How do you afford to travel?.... We work and make an average income. We can work anywhere there is an internet connection and since we don't have mortgage payments, car payments insurance etc. we can afford it. We find it cheaper to travel full time than have the lifestyle we once had.

How much do you spend on travel?.... Every video usually has certain costs of what we spend on food and activities. Check out this video to see how we spent for an entire year: 

Do you make money on Youtube?…. Not Really. The first 1.5 years on Youtube we have averaged about $50USD a month. It has picked up a little recently but we are still a long way off from recouping the many thousand we have spent in camera gear, other equipment, software, etc. Not to mention it takes around 10-15 hours to film and edit a single video. So needless to say we aren’t in it for the money. We do however really appreciate the periodic PayPal/ Venmo/ Zelle donations and those donations from the few live streams we have done.  Having a Youtube channel helps us connect better with people and learn more about the places we visit. That is why we try not to only entertain but to give back real info to others traveling to these areas.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel
170,EFQuYOU,Hong Kong Travel Tips: 11 Things to Know Before You Go,"11 things YOU need to know before you go to Hong Kong. A comprehensive travel guide to bring you up to speed on the Weather, Language, Getting Around, and more! Hong Kong was originally a British Colony founded in 1842, taken over by China in 1997. Hong Kong’s Official Name is the “Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.” In Chinese Hong Kong Means “Fragrant Harbor.” Hong Kong is Famous for Skyscrapers (it has 8,000 of them), but 40% of it’s land is park and nature preserve
Hong Kong has 3 main areas, Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories
But in total it has 263 islands

2 - Weather
Hong Kong's climate is sub-tropical, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius in winter and exceeding 31 degrees Celsius in summer
Pretty humid all year round
May to November is typhoon season
June & August are the wettest
January and December are the dryest

3. Getting In
Likely flying in to Hong Kong International Airport - HKG.
 
It’s on Lantau Island, and its HUGE!  The size of 20 soccer fields.
 
You can fly to almost anywhere in the world from Hong Kong (more than 100 airlines operate 1,100 daily flights to and from 190 destinations worldwide) 
 
Cathay Pacific is Hong Kong’s home airline and has won “World’s Best Airline” four times – more than any other.

Airport Express train to Central - Its just 24 minutes, and leaves every 10 minutes
You can buy a round trip airport Express and Octopus card for 3 days unlimited MTR for $350

Taxi one way to Hong Kong Island would be about $400 HKD and take 45 mins to an hour

4. Unlucky
This number omitted because it’s unlucky.  4 in Chinese sounds like the word for “Death.”  Most buildings typically omit this floor.


5. Getting Around
By public transit—it's efficient, clean, and affordable
First things first, buy an Octopus Card -- It works on almost everything, even to get you in to the Hong Kong Horse Racetrack
MTT - Subway
Star Ferry - About $3 HKD, Upper Deck & Weekends cost a bit more.
Tram - Ding Ding - $2.60
Double Decker Bus
Mini Bus
Taxi - Relatively inexpensive, but can be hard to hail during rush hour, or a rainy day, or shift change between 3-4pm.
Don’t try to hail a cab if you see double yellow lines by the curb. Taxis can only stop if there is a single line—or none at all.
Uber


6. Money
Hong Kong Dollar
Exchange Rate fixed to the USD.  1 USD = HK$7.75–7.85
Most places take Visa/Mastercard
40% take AMEX
Lots of ATMS -- Hong Kong is a huge financial center after all
Bills: Issued by 3 different banks, so you’ll see 3 different designs for all the bills
HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000
Coins: 


7. Language
2 Official Languages
1.Chinese, (Spoken Cantonese)
2. English
 
In the major urban districts, most residents will speak English but Cantonese is the local language
 
If you think you’re planning to learn a little Cantonese before you go… it’s not easy… it has nine tones.

8. Shopping

Shops often stay open late… none of this European 6pm closing time… think 9 or 10pm closing times for most shops and malls

9. Food:

Cantonese Food
And it’s all about sharing, portions are big and made for big groups
Dim sum originated here in southern China and means “touch the heart”. These tiny bites of goodness were created as snack food for travellers and today are an essential part of local culture.
Dim Sum
Hong Kong Milk Tea

Dai Pai Dong, Fast Food Noodle Shops, are common sites in Hong Kong offering an inexpensive bowl of noodles for around HK$20 and free tea

 Bones -- yes, lots of the local food has bones it.  At the casual restaurants you can just put the bones on the table.  At a fancier restaurant use the saucer plate beneath your bowl

Tea -- Need a refill for your teapot?  Turn the lid upside down.

Like to avoid the crowds?  Then avoid eating lunch between 1-2pm, that’s the typical Hong Kong lunch hour

10. Feng Shui
The mystical art of feng shui is still common practice in Hong Kong -- wondering why a building’s architecture looks weird?  The answer usually has to do with Feng Shui… that might be why your hotel lobby has a water feature and some goldfish in it too!

When ready, browse vacation packages to Frankfurt: 

Today,  is home to the European Central Bank, the German Stock Exchange and an airport, which handles almost 60 million travelers a year.
 
Despite its stature as a financial giant, Frankfurt remains surprisingly compact. Most of its attractions are clustered close to the city centre, making it an easy  spot as the city is perfect for exploring on foot or by bicycle.
 
Cross the Eiserner Steg into Frankfurt’s ancient heart, the Römerberg. After being devastated by allied bombs in World War Two, many of the square’s most important buildings have been lovingly restored. From the Römerplatz, head deeper into the old city to  important buildings such as Paulskirche and Goethe-Haus.
 
Don’t miss the many specialist museums, such as the German Film Museum, the German Architecture Museum and the Stadel Museum.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this   as much as we enjoyed making it.

185,Ps_lCNRNDU,Helsinki Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Helsinki.d178...

Finland’s thriving waterfront capital, Helsinki, is situated at the northeastern edge of the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Russia.

Start voyaging through Helsinki’s history by taking the ferry from Market Square to Suomenlinna Fortress, the battlements of which have protected the Gulf of Finland for almost 300 years. 

Helsinki has an abundance of museums and galleries across the city, including the Helsinki Design Museum, which features a permanent exhibition devoted to the great moments of Finnish design.

Continue your design journey at Temppeliaukio Church, a favorite with touring musicians. Helsinki is home to many structures dedicated to theatrical and musical productions. Two of the most iconic are Finlandia Hall and the Helsinki Music Centre. 

Wander through Esplanadi, often referred to as the living room of the city. From here, walk north to Senate Square, which fans out from the fatherly gaze of Emperor Alexander II. 

Climb the stairs to the foot of Helsinki Cathedral, a breathtaking whitewashed structure that towers above the rest of the city. Stare up at the twelve apostles, ten-foot-tall zinc statues which stand like wise custodians. 

In stark contrast to Helsinki Cathedral is its brooding younger brother, Uspenski Cathedral. Built with dark bricks, the cathedral is powerfully conspicuous as it rises from the surrounding white granite of the Katajanokka district. 

Celebrations of education and creativity mean Helsinki is a city designed for life. Its long-held reputation as one of the world’s happiest places lures people from all over the world. And now, it is calling to you.",travel

In this video, we will share a 3-day travel guide on how we explored the city of Vienna during our second video. In this video, we cover the Vienna State Opera House, Schonbrunn Palace, Hofburg Palace, The Austrian National Library, Cafe Central, Prater, and more. 

Vienna is packed with so many great sites, museums, and food. While we did manage to pack a lot within our three days it means that we did have to leave some things out. We hope that this guide will help inspire and give you ideas about your next possible trip to Vienna.

187,D7rLV0XP8bY,Bangkok Travel Tips: 13 Things to Know Before You Go,"Things YOU need to know before YOU go to Bangkok in Thailand. 
 Bangkok is the bustling capital of Thailand with a population of more than 11 million. About 13% of Thailand's population lives in Bangkok.  Bangkok was the world’s top tourist destination with 20 Million Tourists in 2017.  Bangkok is also known as the ""Big Mango.""

2 - Weather

 Hot and Humid!  Really hot and humid!  Like all the time!  
 Daytime highs all year are in excess of 30C/86F
 Bangkok holds claim to being the hottest city in the world
 Not because the highs are the highest, but because it doesn’t cool down at night
 Lows range from 21C to 26C ( 70F-79F )

 April to October is the wet & hot season

 The “cool” and dry season is November to February, like a degree or 2 less on the highs and a few degrees cooler on the lows

3. Getting In

Chances are you’ll be flying in to Bangkok, yes there are buses, and yes there’s a train, and you can take it from Singapore, but most people fly.

2 Airports
Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) and Don Mueang Airport (DMK).
Most international flights go in to BKK

By Rail:
The Airport Rail Link connects Suvarnabhumi Airport with the BTS Skytrain system, which is Bangkok’s primary public transportation system. The City Line connects with the BTS Skytrain at Phayathai Station and costs 45 baht from Suvarnabhumi.

By Taxi:
Metered taxis are available from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Bangkok. 

4. Getting Around

MRT Subway
Fare varies according to age

People don’t stand in lines. Instead of queuing up, Thais form a crowd. Stand your ground, and get used to a lack of personal space in public places.


Taxis
 Notorious for ripping off tourists.  Make sure they turn on the meter.  It should start at 35 THB.  Or download the GrabTaxi app -- like Uber, but cheaper.

Tuk Tuk
A small vehicle with no windows or doors but with a roof and a seat.
Price is always negotiated
Make sure to hold on the handles, tuk tuk drivers can be crazy drivers

Motorbike Taxis
Best to get through traffic
And come with a free massive heart attack!

5. Money
Thai Baht

1 Thai Baht was about $.03 US
Or 33 Baht to 1 USD

In Thailand, there are 1 baht, 2 baht, 5 baht, and 10 baht coins and 20 baht, 50 baht, 100 baht, and 1,000 baht notes. You may also occasionally see a 10 baht note, although those are no longer printed.


Get it from an ATM, but select “Continue Without Conversion”

6. What to wear

Linen, Rayon, or wicking/quickdry fabrics

DON’T WEAR JEANS -- you’ll combust!  Also don’t wear anything lined with Polyester -- it’s as good as wearing a ziplock bag.

Temples and Palaces require you to cover your shoulders and knees. 
pay attention to see if others have taken off their shoes. If so, follow suit.


7. Language
Big cities like Chiang Mai and Bangkok have a lot of locals who speak English

""Sawadiikaa"" for females, and ""Sawadiikrap"" for males - This is the Thai greeting for hello and goodbye, and is accompanied by the ""wai"" gesture. 
placing hands palms together at your chest and bowing your head
Also note that adding kaa or krap to any sentence in Thai makes the sentence more polite.
""Kapkhunkaa"" for females, and ""Kapkhunkrap"" for males - This means thank you, and it is also often accompanied by the ""wai"" gesture.
""Chuai buht meter dai mai kaa/krap?"" - ""Could you turn on the meter?""
""Gepdthang noi"" - Check please.
""Mai ao"" - This verbatim means ""I'm not getting that,"" but can generally be used to deny an interest in purchasing anything.
""Krungthep"" - This is the word for Bangkok in Thai. Many people mistakenly assume Bangkok is a Thai word. It's not, and knowing the real word can come in handy.

8. Shopping

9. Food

10. Bug Spray

11. Respect the King and the Royal Family

12. Don’t touch anyone on the head.

194,RcYJ0wArzq8,Oahu Travel Tips: 10 Things to Know Before YOU Go,"10 things you must know before you travel to Oahu in Hawaii.  Oahu is the 3rd largest among the Hawaiian Islands, but the most populated with about 1 million residents.  Honolulu, the capital of Hawaii is located in the island of Oahu. Oahu is sometimes known as the “Manhattan of the Pacific.” While Oahu is lined with sandy stunning Beaches, Impressive Mountains, make no mistake, this is a buzzing metropolis,  a tropical city. You can drive around the Island in a day, but there’s easily a weeks worth of stuff to do.

2 - Major areas of Oahu 
Waikiki
North Shore
Windward Coast
Leeward Coast
3 - Weather
4 - When to go
5 - Beaches
ocean temperature in Oahu ranges from a cool 72 degrees to a warm 81 degrees Fahrenheit (22 – 27 °C)
My favorite is Hanauma Bay and Ko Olina.
Waikiki is packed -- tough to get any sand there.  If a beach has “beach park” in the name, it’s usually good for few crowds.  I do like to swim in the protected swimming area.
Be careful of coral, and sharp rocks.  Stay 6 feet away from turtles
Watch my video on the best beaches in Oahu.
6 - Shopping
Ala Moana
Waikiki main street
Waikiki Royal Hawaiian Center has 150 shops
ABC Stores
Costco
Don Quixote

7- Transportation
       Oahu Traffic is Epic -- worse from 3pm-6pm
       And even when there isn’t any traffic, it’s slow.  35 MPH Speed limits are common.  Be patient.  Merging traffic, one car from the left, one car from the right.  Flash a shaka to say thanks.
      Renting a car?  Rent it at the airport for the Cheapest Rates.  And use Costco Travel!
      Staying in Waikiki?  Maybe you don’t need a rental car.  Parking is expensive.
      Oahu has a pretty good bus system
      Uber and Taxis are plentiful
      Waikiki trolley, bring your JCB card!

8 - Hotels

Most hotels are in Waikiki
Ko Olina (Aulani)
North Shore (Turtle Bay and a Courtyard)
But they aren’t cheap… decent hotels are around $200 a night, plus high taxes, and resort fees… and parking.

If you're  military...active, retired, or reservist,  you can stay on base for next to nothing.

9 - Food 
Local restaurant chain that I recommend you check out called zippys. They're fairly cheap, pretty tasty, and it's local Hawaiian food. There are locations all over the island but the one that I recommend is in pearl city on kamahmaha highway. It will look like it's a take out only place but there are stairs on the side for you to talk up to the seating area.
Alo Moana Food Court is one of the largest in the US and has seating for 1500.

195,8P-iPXsylrk,Traveling Ecuador by train | DW Travel Documentary,"The train line through Ecuador is considered one of the most spectacular train lines in South America. A train journey of discovery.

The Trans-Andean railroad takes in the infamous Nariz del Diablo, or Devil’s Nose, a mountain with almost perpendicular walls. To overcome this obstacle, the train zigzags to ascend 500 meters in less than 12 kilometers. With steep ascents and descents, it’s no ride for the faint-hearted! The main line along the country’s Andean spine links the coastal city of Guayaquil with the capital Quito. It was finished in 1908, but was mostly shut down after a series of weather-related disasters destroyed much of the Ecuadorian rail network in the 1990s. After extensive restoration, a new cross-Andean service was opened in 2013, following the original narrow-gauge line. It’s 450 kilometers long and runs from the Pacific coast up to the Andean highlands. On its cross-country journey, the train is accompanied by guards on motorcycles who, in the absence of railway gates, stop traffic at every level crossing along the way to let the train pass. The Tren Crucero, - or ""cruise train""- is the centerpiece of Ecuador’s rejuvenated railway. A revamped luxury steam train, it runs once a fortnight and has room for 54 passengers. The most exhilarating stretch of the ride begins deep down in the gorge of the River Chanchán. The train zigzags up the Nariz del Diablo - the ""Devil's Nose"" - in a series of dizzying switchbacks in which the tracks almost seem to lie on top of each other. Join the reporters for the ride of a lifetime, as the train journeys on to Urbina, the highest station at 3,609 meters above sea level, and along the so-called Avenue of Volcanoes, to the Cotopaxi National Park and onwards to Quito, the world's highest capital.

 has long remained in the American imagination as a land little touched by humanity. From the steaming power of erupting geysers, to the thundering might of the Yellowstone River, this magnificent landscape is testament to the power and beauty of Mother Nature. 

When European explorers first ventured into these enchanting lands, they returned with stories which most people dismissed as hallucinations. Since then, it has become one of America’s ultimate   destinations and provides a home for the largest remaining herd of wild bison on the planet. Welcome to Yellowstone, the grandfather of all national parks.

Summary:
1. When Is It Best To Buy Tickets?

Buying tickets can be a tricky part of the trip planning process. Time can be the difference in hundreds of dollars. Whether you choose to book last minute, or several months in advance, there will undoubtedly be price differences, and they’re always changing.

2. Airline Employees And Their Closest Family Get Reduced Cost Air Tickets.

For many airlines worldwide, employees of the company are offered cheaper, even free, tickets for themselves, and their immediate family. In most cases, the employee will only be charged the taxes and duties, leaving the cost of the flight free of charge. 

3. The 7 Most Common Reasons Why Luggage Get Lost. 

When travelling, worrying about your luggage can be one of the most stressful parts of your journey. We all want the things that we packed to stay close to us, and not be tampered with. Sometimes, it can be out of our own control, unfortunately. 

4. Locks Don’t Protect Luggage From Being Opened.

This is a common idea that most travelers have; placing a lock on the outside zipper of your luggage. Though this may seem secure, and only you really have the keys to unlock it, there are too many professional thieves who can easily pick it and open it.

5. Why It’s Really Forbidden To Smoke Onboard.

Smoking on airplanes has long been a thing of the past, with people having their speculations as to why. Some may think it is a potential fire hazard, however, smoking was once allowed on airplanes, and there weren’t any related fires. 


6. Why Passengers Are Asked To Turn Off Their Cell Phones.

Though we may think that our cell phones can cause critical interference or malfunctions on the airplane, that isn’t exactly the truth. It does, however, create static on the radio signal, which can lead to miscommunication from the pilots, and missing key information for the dispatcher.

7. Aisle And Window Seat Armrests Can Be Raised.

Comfort is a big thing on an airplane. Often times, we find ourselves crammed next to others, sharing an armrest. To our luck, we have access to both armrests, and they can both be raised and adjusted. 

8. The Reason Why There Are Hand Grips At The Door Inside The Plane.

Some of us may have wondered why there are hand grips on the door inside of the plane. This is intended for flight crew in the event of a panic situation, where individuals can easily react and knock them down or even out of the plane. The hand grips will help the employee stay upright and keep their balance at a time like this.

9. The Captain And Co-Pilot Are Fed Differently.

The captain and co-pilot eat two separate meals during the flight, due to the risk of one of them potentially having a reaction or get poisoned, and are therefore unable to operate the aircraft. In this case, the pilot will get substituted by the other. This ensures that they aren’t both phased by any intake that will hinder their performance.

10. Not All Minor Failures Are Repaired Immediately.

Welcome to Lisbon!

Lisbon is Portugal's unassumingly cool capital and western Europe's oldest city that serves over 12 million tourists every year. Way back in 1755 the city was hit by a huge earthquake that destroyed 85% of buildings. The city had no choice but to rebuild itself and the 18th century architecture that reshaped Lisbon is still very dominant today. In fact if you come here, don’t be surprised to spend most of your time looking up and admiring it as you wander through the fairy tale cobbled streets lined with iconic Portuguese tiles that have inspired artists for generations. Each building and street really does have its own personality. What’s more, amongst this wealth of history, is an eclectic city renowned for having colourful nightlife, tonnes of culture, music and a cosmopolitan food scene that modestly boasts the best custard tarts on the planet! This city break is ideal all year round, with temperatures rarely going below 10 degrees celsius in the winter and averaging 25 in the summer. It really does seem like Lisbon has it all, and we're here to show you why…

Coming up we’re going to take you through our top tips for 48 hours in Lisbon. From transport, things to do, places to see, lingo, and where to buy the best custard tarts in the city. We’ve done the research to save you time and help you have the most amazing trip. So let’s start with how to get here.

The flight from London Gatwick takes just over 2 and a half hours straight into Lisbon’s only airport which is conveniently just 7km from the heart of the city. 

The best thing about Lisbon Airport is it’s only a 20 minute drive into the city centre. The easiest way to get in is to jump in a taxi or take the Aerobus. There are two lines running into the main hotel areas that cost €4 per person each way. 

Alternatively you could take the metro that runs from 6am to 1am everyday or there’s always the city bus but do expect for both these options to take a little longer. 

Lisbon is known as the city of seven hills so to save your legs from all that climbing you’ll probably gonna want to use public transport at some point. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to get around the city - from train, tram, metro, bus and even funicular lift.

The metro is good choice if you’re traveling long distances but doesn’t cover all areas of the city. It’s one of cleanest metros in Europe, and most stations are open from 6am to 1am every day. 

Trams cover areas of the city where there is no access to the metro. There are two types of trams, the yellow “Remodelado” trams that route round the old narrow streets and then there’s modern “Articulado” trams that operate along the flat sections of the city connecting central Lisbon to the Belem district.

Lisbon has hundreds of buses and 88 different routes so you’re bound to find one to take you where you need to go. 

The funicular lifts are used to help locals and tourists climb all those hills. The most famous lift is the Santa Justa Lift linking lower and upper Lisbon. Yes, it’s technically a means of public transport  but it also doubles up a a major tourist attraction and has great a view point at the top. 

We noticed a lot of tourists jumping in Tuk Tuks, and so we thought we’d give it a go. But it turns out the cobbled streets of Lisbon don’t make for a comfy ride in a Tuk Tuk, and if I’m honest a 5 minute ride was a bit of a rip off at €15.",travel

216,GUMXv0VE,Mexico City Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Mexico-City.d...

Mexico City is one of the financial powerhouses and cultural capitals of Latin America; it’s also a city of color.
  
Mexico City’s colors run deepest in the main square, the Zócalo, once the epicenter of the Mexican Civilization. Today, this area is presided over by a temple of a different kind, The Metropolitan Cathedral.
 
Throughout the Centro Histórico district, over 1500 heritage buildings vie for your attention. The streets of this district overflow with museums and galleries. For a window into the life and color of yesteryear, visit the fabulous Museo Franz Mayer.
 
For a change of color, head to Chapultepec Park, one of the largest urban parks in the world. The park is home to cultural institutions such as the Auditorio Nacional and the Museum of Anthropology, as well as the popular Chapultepec Zoo.  
 
Pay your respects to the Niños Heroes, a monument which honors the six boy soldiers who gave their lives defending Castillo de Chapultepec. Today, the castle serves as the National Museum of History.
 
Just to the north is Nuevo Polanco, a former warehouse area rapidly being transformed by new architectural visions, such as the Museo Soumaya and Museo Jumex.
 
To the south of the city is Coyoacán. In the early 20th century the district’s artists, writers and intellectuals inspired not only Mexico, but the entire world. Visit The Blue House, the birthplace of Frieda Kahlo, and the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo, where these two giants of Mexican art worked, lived and loved.  
 
Just to the south are the incredible murals and buildings of Ciudad Universitaria, which, when constructed in the 1950s, was the city’s largest single building project since the time of the Aztecs.
 
The spirit of bohemia continues amid the sophisticated hues and beauty of districts such as Roma and Condesa. At Xochimilco, simply float away on a riot of color on the last of the city’s Aztec canals.
 
In Mexico City there is color everywhere, and once you experience it, your memories will never fade.",travel

224,45ETZ1xvHS0,London Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Catch a glimpse of the famous London town! Or more than a glimpse – we’ll show you through the whole city.

When ready, browse vacation packages to London: 

A trip to  might as well be a trip through history. This city is full of modern construction mixed with ancient buildings. 

Your London  must include St. Paul’s Cathedral, one of its most well-known churches. You’ll also want to see the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Abbey for exquisite examples of the city’s famous architectural landmarks. Walk or jog through numerous green spaces, among them Hyde Park and Green Park, in the center of London.

Continue your London  in the West End, where you’ll find ancient buildings converted into modern shops, restaurants, bars, and shows. You’ll find one of the largest theatre districts in the world here, and can take in a different play almost every night of the week. 

Climb aboard the London Eye and see the old and new parts of the city all at once.

For now, we hope you enjoy watching this   as much as we enjoyed making it.

Tokyo, a city of 30 million, is a place where traditions and modern inventions live together. From the Tokyo Tower one can see only skyscrapers, palaces made of concrete and glass, multi-level highway junctions and monorail expresses. But under the neon lights there are still rickshaw runners pulling their carts and geishas walking in their wooden shoes. The ornamented pagodas, the Japanese gardens, the calm Shintoist sanctuaries tell us about the age of shoguns and ninjas. The digital cameras and the swords of the samurais can be found at the same store. In the restaurants one can have sushi, sukiyaki and tempura sitting on a tatami, using chopsticks. We can take a look at the masterpieces of ikebana and origami and the pictures painted on rice paper. The travelers can take a trip to the ancient city of Kyoto, to the giant Buddha of Kamakura, to the warm springs and to the Sacred Mountain, Fujiyama, where the cherry trees are blossoming at the foot of the hills.

230,_TKIM1vUE,Manchester Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Manchester is a city of firsts. It was the epicenter of the Industrial Revolution, the place where mankind first split the atom, and the birthplace of the modern computer.
 
The many chapters of Manchester’s story come together in Castlefield. Here you’ll find the remains of a Roman fort, Bridgewater Canal, and some of the mills which once generated incredible wealth for the city. In the background, Beetham Tower is a symbol of a city again on the rise.
 
Manchester’s crowning glory is its Town Hall, built to rival the great buildings of London. During the Industrial Revolution, Manchester’s merchants went on a spending spree, scouring the world in search of cultural treasures to fill their stately homes. Many of these treasures now reside in the Manchester Art Gallery and the Manchester Museum.
 
In 1653, the Chetham Library became the country’s first free public library and has been open to all ever since. Two hundred and fifty years later, one of the city’s greatest philanthropists, Enriqueta Rylands, unveiled the John Rylands Library, dedicated to the memory of her textile magnate husband.
 
Housed in a restored Edwardian pump house is The People’s History Museum, which celebrates those who challenged Britain’s rigid political and class systems. At the world’s oldest surviving railway station, you’ll find The Museum of Science and Industry, while the Imperial War Museum North reminds us of the human cost of warfare.
 
Explore the city’s musical heritage in the Northern Quarter, and check out Canal Street, which perfectly encapsulates the Mancunian ideals of tolerance and good times. Learn more about the city’s footballing history at the National Football Museum, or time your visit for a match at Old Trafford.

234,JRaakIL-N_,Fiji Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Fiji.d6023598...

The locals in Fiji have a saying, “Bula,” which means “life” and “good health.” You’ll hear it used frequently as a greeting when you arrive at the 330-strong islands that comprise this archipelago. You may even find yourself saying it before long!

Any Fiji tour will highlight its magnificent, unspoiled waters and lush landscapes. Go snorkeling, swimming, diving, and sailing on turquoise waters. If you’d rather stay on dry land, you can zipline through rainforests or explore the windy plains of the highland area. Travel to the interior and learn about traditional Fijian culture, or visit the capital city of Suva and wander through its colonial buildings, bazaars, and the quiet harbor. 

Two-thirds of the Fijian archipelago are uninhabited, and your Fiji sightseeing should include a stop at Denarau’s marina, where you can book a boat to take you to some of these pristine locations. From family-friendly islands to romantic getaways, you’ll find something to your taste amongst these scattered isles.

Do you have a favorite memory of Fiji? Share it below!

244,Egzd7PsmNT,St. Helena - a remote island in the Atlantic | (Travel Documentary) DW Documentary,"Every third week, a British Royal Mail ship begins its journey from Cape Town to Saint Helena, the remote island in the Atlantic where Napoleon was once in exile.

It’s like the end of the world in the middle of the Atlantic. Five days, with a northwesterly course, and only then do the sheer black cliffs appear in front of RMS St. Helena. The island’s 4500 residents are often waiting impatiently for the ship’s arrival and panic if the schedule changes. Director Thomas Denzel and his team went on the journey to Saint Helena and met the people living on the island. Many of the residents are descendants of people who were sent into exile there by the British crown - the most famous among them, the French Emperor Napoleon. This is a report about life at the end of the world, loneliness, unique vegetation, and a very special journey.

Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
Canada is a stunning destination that provides travellers an endless natural playground to get lost in. From the incredible mountain ranges of British Columbia to the coves and cliffs of Canada's East Coast (and everywhere in between), the True North strong and free has it all.

The country is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories, each with their own unique cultural backgrounds, adventurous activities and impressive landscapes. Consider booking a tour that focuses on a specific region so that you can experience it thoroughly - the country is huge, making it unlikely to able to enjoy everything if you rush across the country in a single trip. 

Remember to pack clothes appropriate for the province or territory you’re visiting. Depending on the season you travel, pack everything from your swimsuit to your parka. 

You can exchange your money into Canadian dollars in any major city, at airports or at the countless ATMs located throughout the country. Credit card and debit transactions are incredibly common, so in most case you will have no trouble using them in lieu of cash. Dining out doesn’t have to be expensive if you visit the right restaurants, and you'll have to cross off the classics like poutine, sugar pie and craft beer! 

We'd like to thank a few of Canada's incredible tourism boards for allowing use of their travel footage:






— About Canada —
Canada's 10 provinces are Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland & Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. Don't forget the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut!

A seeker asks Sadhguru, is it true that time and space do not really exist? Only because you have a physical body, Sadhguru answers, are time and space a reality in your experience.

Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. An arresting blend of profundity and pragmatism, his life and work serves as a reminder that yoga is a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.

254,CQE-D6AqNY,10 Essential Travel Packing Tips & Hacks - Minimalist Traveling,"How to Pack Light & Smart - Essential Travel Packing Tips for Minimalist Traveling.  Audible is offering our followers a free 30-day trial today.  Sign up to check out their audio books using our special link: http://www.audible.com/exploringalter...

Want more travel packing tips?  Check out this NEW video we made for extra light minimalist travel:   

After almost 5 years of travelling, we've come up with our 10 best travel packing tips to help you travel light, save money, and have an easy and comfortable trip.

1. Minimalist Travel Wardrobe

We choose clothes that are all in the same colour scheme and style so they can be layered to create different outfits for different situations and climates. In our experience, packing fewer clothes is always best and if you find that you're missing something, like a warmer sweater, you can always pick it up along the way.

2. Water

After buying and throwing out countless plastic water bottles on our travels, we finally said enough is enough.  It was a waste of money and plastic.  So we decided to get a portable water purifier (SteriPEN sent us one) and now we bring our own stainless steel water bottles with us and we purify tap water wherever we are.

3. Books and Guides

Books and guides are easily the heaviest things we carry on trips.  To downsize the weight in our backpack or suitcase, we try to bring smaller travel journals, we don't bring guide books (we use our iPod and free maps from airports and train stations to get around), and we're starting to try eBooks (free from the library) and audio books from Audible (our video sponsor!).

4. Staying Clean

When travelling, there are many times (for us at least) when we don't shower as often as we'd like, maybe a long 48 hour travel leg, or a nasty hostel shower that we don't want to use.  To stay fresh between showers, we use dry shampoo (the one in the video is from One Love Organics) and wet wipes (paraben-free).  We also always travel with Dr Bronners soap because we can use it for everything: showering, dishes, and laundry.

5. Souvenirs

We no longer buy souvenirs for our friends and family.  Instead, we try to send postcards to show people we're thinking of them.  It's cheaper, less wasteful, and we feel that it's more meaningful overall.

6. Passports

We've had a passport stolen, and another damaged by water.  We're not messing around with our passports anymore so we carry them in ziplock bags, inside a hidden passport pouch.

7. Food and Snacks

Food and snacks at airports and in touristy areas is usually overpriced and not necessarily healthy.  We try to pack our own food and snacks as much as possible (sandwiches, granola bars, hummus and crackers, oatmeal, roasted nuts, etc.) but it's important to check the rules about what you can bring and where.  

8. Electronics

When we're not travelling for work, we try to bring just our iPod touch.  We travelled for almost one full year with just the iPod & free wifi, and we did all of our hotel and flight bookings, and even a couple of visa applications on the tiny screen.  It's not perfect, but it saves us from lugging around a couple of laptops like we do now.

We also always travel with a flashlight. We have a Foxelli headlamp that is USB rechargeable and the battery lasts forever (they sent us the headlamp a couple of years ago and we love it).

9. Reusables

Travel has a pretty big environmental footprint and while we haven't quite gotten to the point where we're willing to stop just for environmental reasons, we do try to minimize flying and we travel with reusable containers to limit the amount of garbage waste we're producing.  We bring stainless steel food containers (by Onyx), water bottles, and coffee mugs, as well as cloth bags and cutlery.

10. Staying Healthy

We use natural remedies like oregano oil, garlic pills, activated charcoal, and essential oils to treat things like food poisoning, cold and flu, diarrhea, headaches, etc.  We also bring strong anti-nausea pills because Danielle gets motion sick in cars, planes, buses — even a hammock once!

Thanks for watching!

Paul is a Physics teacher at Prescott High School and teaches Engineering 101 at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He began college studying mechanical engineering at Case Western Reserve University but discovered his passion was in teaching. He graduated from the University of Virginia with a Bachelor’s degree in Physics and a Master’s degree in Teaching.

Ecuador is one of the most diverse countries in the world though it's comparably tiny. Beside the Galapagos Islands (which is the #1 tourist destination in Ecuador) the country has a lot more to offer, therefore I focussed on ""La Sierra"" in this video which is a paradise for landscape lovers and outdoor adventurers.

Another reason to visit the Andean region is that you have the chance to dive into the local culture and get a real feeling of Ecuador. The places to see in Ecuador I focussed on in this short video are the result of my own travels along the center from north to south and are easily doable in 2 weeks time.

Things to do in Ecuador covered in this video:
01)  - Otavalo market in Otavalo
02)  - Hike the Cuicocha lake
03)  - Middle of the World, Mitad del Mundo & Quitsato in Cayambe
04)  - Quito, capital & UNESCO World Heritage
05)  - Termas de Papallacta (hot springs)
06)  - Cayambe Coca National Park
07)  - Quilotoa & Shalala viewpoint
08)  - Tren Crucero & Nariz del Diablo (Devil's nose)
09)  - Inka ruins in Ingapirca
10)  - Cuenca & it's beautiful old town

What are your best things to do in Ecuador?
I’m looking forward to more tips from other travelers and Ecuador experts. Have you been and know of some cool places? Let us know in the comments below!

Since ancient times, people tried to explain numerous miraculous things that exist on our planet. Many people to this day do not believe that one can travel through time, but the physicists seem to not agree with them. Even Albert Einstein claimed that people can take a trip through time. He recognized time travel as an idea that could be applied to his theory of relativity. The majority of such things have yet to be explained scientifically. However, there are still some phenomena that are hard to believe. 
We in Smart Banana believe that our adventure through time has taken the most serious turn. Let’s look closely at 10 best examples it actually exists.

274,r3O7ArQTYY,Seoul Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/explore/south...

Welcome to Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Start your adventure at the K-Style Hub, a state-of-the-art visitor centre where South Korea’s past, present and future converge.
 
At the head of Gwanghwamun Square sits the statue of Sejong the Great, whose reign oversaw a golden age of literature, science and technology. The great leader sits before the grandest of Seoul’s five royal palaces, Gyeongbokgung, the Palace of Shining Happiness.
 
A short bus or subway ride to the east, are the adjoining palaces of Changdeokgung and Changgyeongung, while just to the south at Deoksugung Palace, see the changing of the guard which takes place three times each day.
Just to the west, is the last of Seoul’s great palaces, Gyeonghuigung, a royal refuge in times of unrest.
 
After exploring Seoul’s temple complexes, see how ordinary Koreans once lived at the Namsangol Hanok Village. Then explore the Korea Furniture Museum where over 2000 exquisite items of furniture are displayed within ten traditional houses. The story of Korean craftsmanship continues at the National Museum of Korea, which houses national treasures such as the Ten Story Pagoda.
 
Close to Seoul’s great South Gate is Namdaemun Market, where locals have been bargaining hard for over 600 years. Looking for some Gangnam style? Head just upriver to Samseong-dong, the Beverly Hills of Seoul.
 
Spend a few hours in the wooded surrounds of the Bongeunsa Buddhist Temple, a peaceful antidote to the fierce pace of Seoul’s shopping. Then hike to the peak of Namsan, and take in the sweeping views from Seoul’s iconic tower. When the sun gets low, join locals on the banks of the Han River to see the Banpo Bridge erupt in waves of water and light.",travel

Welcome to Sri Lanka!

This island off the coast of India has long been on my bucket-list for loads of reasons, like having the best safari outside of Africa, boasting eight UNESCO World Heritage sites to explore, and lots of lovely, gorgeous beaches complete with idyllic white sand and crystal clear water that's perfect for surfing. 

In fact, for an island about a ¼ of the size of the UK, there's loads to see and do, depending,  of course,  on what you want out of your trip.

Coming up, I'm going to tell you about getting here, some tips on transport, then some stuff on food, money and language and some awesome places to visit. 

So, let's get on with it… 

We flew 10 hours direct from Heathrow to Colombo, which is Sri Lanka’s capital city. Flights arrive at Bandaranaike International airport, which is 30km north of the city. 

Taxis are very cheap in Sri Lanka, and this can be the easiest, and certainly quickest way to reach your destination from the airport. If you’re heading straight into Colombo you can catch the express bus which takes about 25 minutes, but to be honest the taxis are so cheap it’s a no-brainer.

To enter the country, you’re gonna need a visa. Now this can be done when you get here, but, after ten hours in the air ..why bother with the extra admin!? 

Get it done before you leave. Applications cost $35 and take around 24 hours to process.

Also, you’re gonna need to make sure that your vaccinations are up to date, like your tetanus and typhoid. Check with your GP beforehand.

What do you need to know about public transport in Sri Lanka? Well, in all honesty, quite a bit…

Public transport conditions aren't great, but are popular with locals as it's very cheap.

Buses tend to leave when they’re full, so for anyone on a schedule we’d give them a miss. 

Also, trains are often slower and less efficient than simply getting a taxi.

My advice: take anything described as luxury or express with a generous pinch of salt.

The key thing in Sri Lanka is that your money goes a long way, for example our two-hour taxi  from Colombo to Unawatuna cost 9000 rupees, which is about 40 quid, so for this reason we made the most of getting around with private car hire and tuk-tuks.

Hiring a driver to chauffeur you around is surprisingly affordable and, let's face it, way more luxurious! It's also a big timesaver which is a massive a bonus. 

The roads are in surprisingly good condition...

...just watch out for the tourists, the cyclists, the buffalo, stray dogs, and massive lizards they all make it a little hair-raising at times. 

We used Uber to navigate Colombo and Red Cabs for everywhere else.

Failing that you could always haggle for a tuk tuk, which are ideal for quick journeys. There are a couple of things you need to know before you start off. Number 1 always agree the price before settings off and number 2 be direct about where you want to go, don’t settle for any detours or any other places they might want to take you.

Anyway, up next, here are some of my favourite things to do in Sri Lanka.

Unawatuna is loved by locals and tourists alike, and with palm trees, white sands and blue waters, it's easy to see why it’s one of Sri Lanka’s most popular beaches.

Right behind the beach is a small shopping strip for souvenirs and restaurants...

… And Ladies, going topless on the beach is a definite no-no, and if you're a couple, make the P in PDA stand for PRIVATE, not PUBLIC. 

OK, Newsflash!!! Sri Lanka has the best safari outside of Africa since the country has one of the highest rates of indigenous plants and animals in the world. Udawalawe National Park is a personal highlight of mine and home to some 200 different species.",travel

289,9fJEFi3ccwI,Yosemite National Park Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Yosemite-Nati...

Yosemite National Park sits on the western slopes of California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains. Most visitors spend their time in Yosemite Valley, which despite being only 7 miles long and 1 mile wide, packs in more jaw-dropping scenery than just about any other place on Earth. 
 
Near the valley entrance stop at Tunnel View, and stand before a panorama that’s reduced generations of visitors to silence. From Tunnel View it’s just a short drive to Bridalveil Fall. Fed by snowmelt, the fall reaches its thundering peak in May. 
 
The Yosemite Valley ring road follows the banks of the Merced River, which shifts in character as it thunders from the valley walls, before gently winding across the valley floor. The ring road is dotted with trailheads that lead to 800 miles of hiking trails. The Four Mile Trail climbs the valley’s southern wall to two of Yosemite’s great outlooks, Glacier Point and Washburn Point. Further along the ring road is the trailhead for The Mist Trail, which offers stunning views of Vernal and Nevada Falls. 
 
For thousands of years, the Ahwaneechee had villages throughout this valley, but it was at the base of Yosemite Falls where their great chief resided. Take the one-hour hike to the lower falls, or spend the day climbing all the way to the upper falls.
 
To the north of Yosemite Valley, is Tioga Road, one of the USA’s most scenic highways. Fill your lungs with alpine air at Olmsted Point, refresh yourself by the waters of Tenaya Lake, then spend the day at Tuolumne Meadow, the traditional summer hunting grounds of the Ahwaneechee. 
 
From its high country to its waterfalls, its towering sequoia groves to its valley meadows, Yosemite is an American story unlike any other.",travel
290,0uawGEzuA1E,What's the Fastest Way to Travel in Minecraft 1.14?,"Travelling long distances in Minecraft doesn't have to be a painful experience, there are some methods that make it incredibly fast! But what is the fastest? This video will tell you!

NETHER LOGIC!
For every block that a player travels in the Nether, they travel 8 blocks in the over world.
So if you have a nether portal at 0,0 in the overworld, and another nether portal at 0, 800; then to connect them up in the nether you would have one at 0,0 and another at 0,100.. Meaning you have travelled 800 over world blocks by going 100 blocks in the nether! Hope this makes sense!

We prepared a new collection of incredible travel ideas that will ease your life during the stay in a hotel. These life hacks will help to turn a hotel room in a very comfortable and safe place. 
If you need to sleep during the day and the curtains don’t close - connect the ends of curtains with hanger clips. It’s highly important to feel safe and hide money during travel.

 Wet socks? Dry them using a hairdryer! This process will take only a couple of minutes! You can make a quick toothbrush holder from a paper cup - flip a paper cup upside down and make a hole for a toothbrush. I have the moment when I need to charge my gadgets but the hotel requires a card for the power to stay on. Find a sheet of paper or a piece of cardboard. 
We share an unusual way to wrap gifts - use road or city maps. Travel addicts will love this idea. Besides, it a cool idea to highlight special places you’ve visited. 
Folding clothes into square shapes
It is not the best way to store clothes in your luggage. Use the rolling method as it can reduce wrinkles and save space. This folding technique works well for shorts, socks, synthetic T-shirts and tank tops, some pajamas and sweats.

Travel to the heart of the Great Pyramid of Giza - the only surviving Wonder of the Ancient World.

Built over four and a half thousand years ago, the pyramid is the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu. You can pass through the solid stone blocks that make up the Pyramid’s core to explore its hidden passages and chambers.

The Great Pyramid’s architects and builders worked with great precision: the access corridors and chambers align almost perfectly on a north-south axis.

25 Things to do in Toronto, Ontario Travel Guide and Top Attractions in Toronto, Canada Video Transcript:

Toronto is considered Canada’s melting pot.

The following travel guide will showcase 25 things to do in Toronto, so if you’re planning a trip here or you need some travel inspiration, be sure to stick around as we take you on a city tour. 

And that’s a wrap for TO! We hope you enjoyed this city guide and that it gave you some ideas of what to see and where to go on your trip.

Science fiction has introduced us all to the idea of traveling into the past – but is it really possible?

Sean Carroll talks bout how time travel would possibly work in the context of Einstein’s theory of general relativity, including the hypothetical idea of wormholes connecting distant regions of space. Dr. Carroll also explores the logical structure of time travel, and what it implies about predestination and free will. In the end, time travel is probably not possible, but by taking the idea seriously we help understand how the universe works.

Dr. Carroll is a Senior Research Associate in Physics at the California Institute of Technology. His most recent book is “From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time”, a popular book on cosmology and the arrow of time. He is a contributor to the blog Cosmic Variance.

316,N4ZMYokojG,Cuba Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/explore/carib...

It’s only 93 miles from Florida, and just 13 from the Bahamas, but like the smoke that coils from its legendary cigars, The Republic of Cuba exists in a time and space all its own.
 
Few cities can stir the imagination like Cuba’s capital, Havana, a city preserved by forts, a five-mile seawall, and an imposed embargo, which held back the excesses of the 20th century for over 50 years.
  
Havana’s lure can be hard to resist, but Cuba offers so much more beyond the seductive lights of its capital. In Cuba, a long sandy beach is never far away. 
 
Just 12 miles from Havana’s downtown, the Eastern Beaches unroll toward the town of Matanzas, the birthplace of the rumba, and Cárdenas, where the Cuban Flag flew for the very first time. From here, follow the scent of fresh lime, rum and suntan lotion north to Varadero. 
 
After exploring the northern coastline, turn south towards Cuba’s most revolutionary city, Santa Clara, and Trinidad, once the sugar capital of the world. Don’t miss elegant Cienfuegos, the only Cuban city founded by the French. 
 
Sometimes it’s hard to know whether Cuba is awakening to the world, or if the world is awakening to Cuba. Whatever your politics, it's easy to admire this island nation that has proudly gone its own way.
 
Cuba may still have one foot firmly in the past, but as the world tumbles towards tomorrow, we can be thankful for the many things it has not let go.",travel

324,rGKf1NhtJ1,Queenstown Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Queenstown.d1...

Queenstown, in New Zealand’s South Island, is the gateway to stunning fiords, glaciers, ski fields and vineyards. This lake-side city provides the pulse that keeps this remote corner of the world energetic and youthful. As the descendants of fierce Polynesian warriors and determined European settlers, the Kiwis have the spirit of adventure running though their veins. 

Experience the beauty of Lake Wakatipu aboard the TSS Earnslaw. Nicknamed “The Lady of the Lake”, for over 100 years this steamship hasn’t missed a beat, transporting livestock and passengers to and from the High Country. Back in Queenstown, soak up the Aotearoa sunshine on a sandy beach or in Queenstown Gardens. For a bird’s-eye view, ride the Skyline gondola to Bob’s Peak. Then when the sun gets low, head to Marine Parade and enjoy Mother Nature’s spectacle with kindred spirits from all over the world. 

Queenstown expands and contracts with the rhythm of the seasons. After the hectic summer, the town transforms into a world-class ski destination. Queenstown has three main ski fields; The Remarkables Ski Field, Cardrona Alpine Resort and the Coronet Peak Ski Area.

When the snow melts, Queenstown transforms again to accommodate visitors who flock to the Arrow Basin to explore its charming historic towns. The Kiwis know when it’s time to slow down, unwind and enjoy the finer things in life. Queenstown and the nearby Gibbston Valley are home to over 75 wineries, where vintners produce pinot noirs acclaimed for their purity, freshness and vitality, a perfect reflection of the region itself!",travel

328,dZYpHr1wDmY,Budapest Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Budapest.d179...

The Hungarian capital, Budapest, is situated on the banks of the Danube in Central Europe. It’s the political, economic and cultural heart of the nation, and one of the most beautiful and livable cities on the continent.
  
For a sweeping overview of the city head to the Buda side of the Danube and take in the views from the 19th century ramparts on Gellért Hill. Just upriver is Budapest’s oldest area, The Castle District, home to Buda Castle, Matthias Church and Fisherman’s Bastion.
 
Once you’ve explored the heights of Castle Hill, cross the Széchenyi Chain Bridge to the Pest side of the city and follow the riverbank upstream to Hungary’s Parliament Building. Nearby, pay your respects at the Shoes on the Danube Memorial, a sobering tribute to the thousands who were executed here during The Second World War.
 
After admiring the magnificent dome of St. Stephen’s Basilica, allow yourself to be swept up Andrassy Avenue. This world heritage listed boulevard opens out onto Heroes’ Square and City Park.  The park is home to the Széchenyi Thermal Baths, just one of the city’s many lavish bathhouses. For many in Budapest, “taking the waters” is a weekly ritual.
 
Whether it’s the sparkling Danube or the thermal springs, there’s something truly rejuvenating in the water here. So when you’re ready to experience moments of refection, inspiration, and sublime beauty, come to Budapest, you’re sure to come away rejuvenated too.",travel
329,I1QBHhbS0,Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180...

The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg’s fairytale setting.
 
Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and provided the settings for one of cinema’s most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. 
  
Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe’s best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you’ll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. 
 
Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Café Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the Müllner Bräu Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world. 
 
Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg’s southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.
 
While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city’s most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe’s highest suspension bridge.
 
The Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",travel

335,XhHwGolzQmg,Hawaii's Big Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Hawaii.d18007...

The “Big Island” of Hawaii is the largest of the Hawaiian Islands, and offers a fascinating and stunning array of beautiful scenery for you to explore.

Sightseeing on Hawaii’s Big Island means your days will be filled with natural wonders: wander around a lava field, stroll through a tropical rainforest, and take a dip in the warm waters of the Pacific. To get the most out of your Hawaii Big Island tour and to get an idea of what areas you’d like to see up close, we suggest renting a car and exploring Hawaii’s Big Island from behind the wheel. The Onomea Bay Scenic Drive, located along the Hamakua Coast, will take you past shimmering emerald rainforest and astonishing glimpses of the tranquil Pacific Ocean. It’s the perfect place to get some pictures and see what the beauty of Hawaii is really about.

No tour of Hawaii’s Big Island is complete without meeting the sea turtles of Kahalu’u Bay. Strap on your mask and snorkel, and swim around the warm, blue-green waters of the bay to get up close and personal with the turtles and thousands of other sea creatures. If hanging out with the sea life isn’t entirely your cup of tea, you can also try paddleboarding, jet skiing, or a variety of other watersports. Alternatively, you can spoil yourself in the time-honored indulgence of relaxing on the black lava sands, soaking up some of the legendary Hawaiian sunshine.

What will you do on Hawaii’s Big Island?

336,nD_dFyfOXI,Patagonia Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Travel to the land that time forgot and set out on the journey of a lifetime in Patagonia, where Mother Nature runs the show. 

Patagonia, the fabled ‘edge of the world’, spans the southernmost regions of Chile and Argentina and can be rugged and desolate as well as breathtakingly beautiful and inviting.

This last frontier of South America is a colorful mosaic of snow-capped mountains,  icebergs, volcanoes, glaciers, forests, lakes and vast steppe plains.

On the Argentinean side, the scenic Road of the 7 Lakes takes you from San Martín de los Andes to Villa La Angostura and finally San Carlos de Bariloche, a popular ski resort on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi.

El Chaltén, in the southern Andes, is Argentina’s trekking capital. Trails lead to Laguna Capri, Fitz Roy Mountain and the fearsome Cerro Torre.

El Calafate is nestled the southern shores of Lago Argentino and is the gateway lake to Los Glaciares National Park. Here, one of the world’s most awe-inspiring glaciers awaits: the Perito Moreno Glacier.

In the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia, take the 'End of the World Train’ to Tierra del Fuego National Park or get there by boat over the Beagle Channel. Photo opportunities along the way include Bird Island, Seal Island and the historic Les Éclaireurs lighthouse.

On the Chilean side of Patagonia, the regional capital Punta Arenas attracts visitors with its colonial architecture, cultural attractions and hospitality.

Tour the region’s Milodón Cave, where the remains of a giant ground-dwelling sloth and other huge extinct species were found.

Torres del Paine National Park is great for horse riding or hiking, with its steppes, snowcapped peaks, brimming lakes and Salto Grande waterfalls.

On the northern border of Chilean Patagonia, in the Los Lagos region, looms the mighty Osorno Volcano. The town of Puerto Varas, on the opposite shores of Lake Llanquihue, marks the end your Patagonia expedition.

337,-PcrLWkxZSk,Minimalist Packing Tips & Hacks - Travel Light With Only Carry-On Luggage!,"Best carry-on packing tips + Get a free audio book download & 30 day free trial from Audible at http://www.audible.com/exploringalter... or text code, ""exploringalternatives"" to 500-500 if you're in the US.

In this video we're tackling the confusing world of carry-on packing.  What is the true size of a carry-on suitcase? What can you bring on board?  How to pack like a minimalist?  We even do a test-pack to show you what we'd pack on a long term trip.

We are big fans of traveling light with only the essentials to carry around.  Travel doesn't just end at the airport.  Whatever you pack for a trip has to be hauled around in taxis, on the bus, on the train, in and out of hotels and hostels.  

With some careful planning, you can have a great trip with small, easy to handle luggage.

A few other reasons why we love carry-on packing is because you can save money by not paying to check a bag, you don't have to wait for your luggage to unload from the plane and waste time at the carousel, and you don't have to worry about losing your luggage or having someone take it by mistake.  

Here are a few TSA (Travel Security Administration) websites to help you figure out what you can, and can't bring on board.  It varies by airline and by country.  We chose these links based on the top countries that watch our videos :)

344,Xk5-2u0kw0,Sao Paulo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"São Paulo, one of the world’s most populated cities, is Brazil’s exciting hub of business, culture, creativity and hospitality.

‘Sampa’ was founded in 1554, at the spot of the historic Pátio do Colégio. Once home to the region’s first main Catholic Church, the central Praça da Sé now houses the towering Metropolitan Cathedral. 

Two beautiful historic buildings have been transformed into Cultural Centers: The Banco do Brazil and the Júlio Prestes Train Station. While the city’s most esteemed museums are the São Paulo Museum of Art, on the famous Avenida Paulista, and the Pinacoteca do Estado.

356,Mkx5sqexl84,Taiwan Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Taiwan.
Taiwan, the Beautiful Island or, ‘Ilha Formosa’: a land of gods, spirits and temples - an island at the end of a rainbow! This south east Asian island is separated from the Chinese mainland by the Formosa Strait that at its narrowest point is a hundred and thirty kilometres wide. Taipei is a pulsating metropolis in the north of the island in which emperors’ treasures and chaotic traffic highlight both industrial strength and a Chinese way of life. In the old town district of Wan Hua is the city’s oldest and most precious Buddhist temple of Lungshan Szu, the Dragon Mountain Temple. The Sun Yi Sen Memorial Hall was built to commemorate the centenary of the founder of the Republic of China. His efforts brought about the abdication of the last emperor and the birth of the Republic Of China. The Confucius Temple is a place of contemplation and is a replica of the Temple Of Qu Fu, Qu Fu having been the home town of Confucius. This silent place is one of five temples in Taiwan dedicated to the great Chinese philosopher, Confucius, the founder of a religion that even today has many followers. The past importance of the former Taiwanese capital of Tainan is indicated by the city’s many temple complexes that contain an abundance of sacred works of art. Religion still plays a central role in the daily life of the people and the Tien Gon Temple is the most important temple in Taiwan. Taiwan is an island full of magical charm, fascinating works of art and breathtaking natural wonders. The legacy of Confucius mixed with the bright hope of the future. A symbiosis of industrialisation and Chinese tradition. The success of capitalism confirmed by the eternal words, “Made in Taiwan“!

For ages I’ve been thinking about doing a video analyzing time travel in fiction and doing a comparison of different fictional time travels – some do use wormholes, some relativistic/faster than light travel with time dilation, some closed timelike curves, some have essentially “magic” or no consistent rules that make any sense, or TARDIS's, or whatever. This video is an explanation of how time travel functions in different popular movies, books, & shows – not how it works “under the hood"", but how it causally affects the perspective of characters’ timelines (who has free will? can you change things by going back to the past or forwards into the future?). In particular, I explain Ender's Game, Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Primer, Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, Back to the Future, Groundhog Day, Looper, the video game “Braid”, and Lifeline.

372,DtW0VqNkM9U,Ottawa Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Ottawa.d17829...

Welcome to Ottawa, Ontario, where you’ll find charming old-world buildings surrounded by picturesque natural beauty. 

The first stop on an Ottawa tour should be the Rideau Canal. This waterway cuts the city in half, and it provides places for boating and paddleboarding during the summer.  Visiting in winter? Not a problem—you can go ice skating along the Rideau when it ices over. On the south side of the river, you can see the Changing of the Guard Ceremony at Parliament Hill. A few blocks to the north is the National Gallery of Canada, a stunning glass-and-granite building full of art from Canadian, European, and other North American artists.

You’ll be hungry after all this walking around, so head to ByWard Market. If you see beavertails, don’t worry; they’re a pastry, not part of an actual beaver—and they’re delicious. ByWard Market also has some of the best fresh produce you’ll ever taste, so stock up on fruits and vegetables while you’re there.

After sampling the fare at ByWard Market, cross the river to visit the Canadian Museum of History in Quebec. This is where you can tour recreations of Old Canada: explore 1800s storefronts, wander into log cabins, and learn about the First Nations people who inhabited Canada for thousands of years prior to European settlement.

Round out your trip with a venture to Gatineau Park, where you can relax by the lake or take tea in the MacKenzie King estate.  

What’s your favorite part of Ottawa?

375,8TJdP1Uf9x8,Japan: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar 2/5,"Japan: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar gives you all the info you need to explore the land of the rising sun. Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
Japan remains one of the most intensely fascinating places in the world, effortlessly intertwining modernity and tradition. Seek serenity in Kyoto by visiting one of thousands of temples spread throughout this former capital, or go skiing in Niseko or summit Mt. Fuji. Of course you can also kick back in one of the country’s many hot springs, where the rich mountain minerals will leave your skin feeling brand new. Once you’ve achieved maximum relaxation, hit up Tokyo’s bustling night life or go hiking in Kamakura. 

What Japan lacks in square footage it makes up for in endless options for your itinerary. In this case, size definitely doesn’t matter! Consider booking a tour that allows you to see all of the country’s unique highlights, without missing the subtleties you can enjoy as a backpacker: 

Remember to pack clothes appropriate for the region you’re visiting, and if you’re planning on travelling from the North to the South outside of summer months, make sure you bring everything from flip-flops to snow boots. 

Japan’s currency is the Japanese Yen. Credit card and debit transactions aren’t common, so be sure to bring plenty of cash with you no matter where you travel within the country. Dining out doesn’t have to be expensive if you visit the right restaurants, and you can often enjoy a pre-fix menu for lunch for a very reasonable cost. Be sure to sample the Japanese whiskeys, as Japan is an expert whiskey distiller! 

— About Japan —

With a population of nearly 130 million, this island nation is resides in the Pacific Ocean and has everything from dense cities to mountainous national parks. You’ll discover that there’s countless reasons to move Japan up to the #1 spot on your bucket list. Sixty-six percent of the country is covered by trees and the Japanese enjoy the highest life expectancy in the world at 83.7 years.

TAKE THE QUIZ: 

TRANSCRIPT

Hello. My name is Emma, and in today's video I'm going to talk about something I love, and that is travel. So, if you like travelling too, if you're planning on going on a vacation, or if you know somebody who's travelling, this video will be very, very helpful to you. In this video I'm going to teach you some very important verbs. They're all phrasal verbs, and I'll explain what a phrasal verb is in a moment. So, these are all verbs that we use when we're talking about travel. Okay.

So, to get started, I wanted to tell you a little bit about phrasal verbs. What is a phrasal verb? One of the difficulties students have with English are verbs where you have a verb and a preposition. So, when you see a verb and a preposition together, that's a phrasal verb. Now, you might be thinking: ""What's a preposition?"" Good question. I'm going to give you an example. We have here four words, each of these is a phrasal verb. They all have the verb ""get"": ""get in"", ""get up"", ""get on"", ""get over"", and there's many more, ""get away"". There's tons of them. Each of these actually can have multiple meanings, too. So, one of the most difficult parts about English is learning phrasal verbs, because this, the blue part is the preposition, it can change the meaning of the verb. Okay? So, prepositions are words like: ""on"", ""off"", ""up"", ""down"", ""toward"", ""over"", ""away"", these types of words are prepositions. So, you'll notice with phrasal verbs, they're very, very common in conversation. They're... You can write them down, too, but in general, when people talk they often use phrasal verbs. Okay? So, they're very, very important, especially when you're talking about going on a trip with your friends or family.

So let's look at some of the common phrasal verbs we use when we're talking about trips. The first verb I want to teach you: ""Drop off"". Okay? So: ""drop"" is the verb, ""off"" is the preposition, together: ""drop off"" is a phrasal verb. What does this mean: ""drop off""? When you ""drop someone off"" it means you're taking them to a place and then you leave them there. So, for example, maybe your friend needs to go to the airport, so you drive them to the airport and you drop them off at the airport. This means you take them there and you leave them in that place. Okay? So they don't come home with you; they stay there. So, for example, I have a friend named Frank, and when Frank goes travelling: ""We drop Frank off at the airport."" So, we drive Frank to the airport, he has all his luggage, his suitcases, and then we say to Frank: ""Goodbye, Frank, you know, have a nice trip."" We drop Frank off at the airport. You can also use ""drop off"" in a lot of other situations. For example, when you were a child maybe your parents, your mom or your dad, or maybe your grandparents dropped you off at school. This means that they took you to school, and then once you got to school, they would say goodbye to you and they would leave. So: ""drop off"" means you take someone to a place, and then you leave them there. You'll also notice... So, I have here the verb and the preposition. ""Frank"" is a name of a person and it's in the middle of ""drop"" and ""off"". Okay? So, these two are not together. We drop somebody off at the airport. Okay? So, sometimes with phrasal verbs... For some phrasal verbs you actually separate them, and you can put the names of somebody between them; for other ones you can't do that. For this one: ""drop off"", you put the name between the two... Between the verb and the preposition.

So, now let's look at another example of a common phrasal verb. ""See off"". Okay? So, again, we have ""off"" in both of these. ""See off"" is when... It's similar to ""drop off"", but it's a little bit different. Sometimes your family or your friends are going away for a long time, maybe they're going on a vacation or a trip, so you want to ""see them off"". It means you want to say goodbye to them at the airport, at the train station, maybe at their house. So, it's that goodbye you say before somebody goes off on a vacation. Okay? So, for example: ""We see Frank off."" Frank is going to Australia, so we go to the airport because we want to say goodbye to Frank, so: ""We see Frank off"" is another way to say: ""We say goodbye to Frank when he goes on his trip.""",travel

381,RX-iFy6qx,Narita Airport to Tokyo - Complete Japan Travel Guide,"Here are tips to get to and from Narita Airport. I've lived  in Japan for almost 15 years now and this advice is based on all my experiences. Hope this video helps.

Check out more info at 

//Timelines//
-Intro

- Overview of transportation options to Narita Airport

The options are...
-Express Train - Narita Express and Keisei Skyliner
-Local Bus
-Bus - LCC and limousine  
-Taxi

Basically LCC buses are the cheapest way to go, and express trains and limousine are about the same price.

- Overview of express train

-Narita Express is great for people staying in south west area including Shinjuku, Shibuya and Tokyo.

-Keisei Skyliner is great for people staying in north east area including Ueno and Nippori.

- How to ride the express train

-From the Airport:
When you arrive at Narita Airport, go to B1. You will find RED Narita Express ticket booth and machines on the right and BLUE Skyliner ticket booth and machines on the left.
-To the Airport:
N'EX - Go to your nearest JR station to buy ticket. You can buy tickets even though express train does not stop at your nearest station. 
Skyliner - Go to Nippori or Ueno to buy tickets.

- Tips on express train

Tip 1 - Arrive to the station 15-20 minutes early (on return) 
There is always a long line at the ticket booth and the platform to get on the train might be quite far from the gate so make sure to arrive early. 

Tip 2 - Use ticket machine when in hurry
Usually you don't need to wait in line for ticket machines to buy a ticket and takes only about 5 minutes. Consider this as an option when you are in hurry.

Tip 3 -  Sit at the front of the car
Luggage compartment is located at the front and the end of the each car of express train. People get stuck when getting the luggage upon arrivals. It is stressful to worry about if you can get out or not so it's good to sit at the front. (the end is ok too.)

Note: About tickets
when you buy tickets by credit card, you will receive 3 tickets - an express train ticket, receipt, and credit card receipt. You need to show only the train ticket to the train attendant.

CORRECTION: X 4 ticket　→　◉ 3 tickets
(I was with my gf so we had 4 tickets.)

 -  Bus
- LCC (Tokyo Shuttle and Access Narita) can take you to/from Tokyo and Ginza Station.
- Limousine Bus runs to/from major hotels. 

 -  How to take the bus
-Limousine Bus and Tokyo Shuttle - At Narita Airport on the first floor, you can find ticket machines and man booth.
-Access Narita - All you need to do is go to the train stop and pay on the bus. No reservation needed.

3. Transportation in Switzerland
 - Really good public transit
 - Always on time
 - Swiss Pass
 - Download the SBB App
 - Second Class is pretty good
4. Money in Switzerland

6. Swiss Food

7. Switzerland is Small
 - Population of 8 Million

393,K7iEJQeVD,11 Cheapest Travel Destinations You NEED TO VISIT NOW,"You don't need to be the richest to travel the world, 11 beautiful destinations that you can visit & they're cheap so a budget is safe.

11 Thailand
10 South Africa
9 Argentina
8 Greece
7 Dominican Republic
6 Honduras
5. Bolivia
Bolivia is one of the most misunderstood countries in South America, and is also one of the cheapest countries to visit. Rich with culture and experiences, Bolivia offers some of the most incredible sights in the world, and at a miniscule price. Traveling in Bolivia can occasionally be a bit uncomfortable as it is not properly set up for tourism, but if you are prepared to rough it a bit, you will have the experience of a lifetime. You can enjoy sights like the amazing Salar de Uyuni salt flats on a two day tour for less than $130 for both days. There is also a collection of museums that you can visit, such as the former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, who was a leader during the 1809 La Paz Revolution. The cost to visit all of the museums is just $1. Bolivia offers some of the cheapest food and drink in the whole of South America, where a Paceña  costs less than $2, and a bowl of hearty potato soup costs about the same.

4. Bulgaria

Bulgaria is often disregarded as a holiday destination, but is has a lot to offer, from some of the most tranquil secluded beaches in Europe, to charming little towns – and all at surprisingly low prices. Small towns such as Varna on the coast, and ancient cities such as Plovdiv offer rich culture and beautiful vistas. There are also many exquisite mountain ranges that you can discover on foot or by bicycle. In the last few years Bulgaria has become a favorite among British travelers, as the Black Sea resorts offer incredibly low prices, and offer facilities comparable to those in destinations such as Spain. Bulgaria is considered an amazing city holiday location, where you can enjoy delicious food, kind company, strong drinks and a comfortable bed in beautiful accommodations for as little as $45 per day, backpacking and let's go!

3. Cambodia
Cambodia is one of the most popular places to visit in Southeast Asia, and also one of the cheapest. Backpackers and luxury holiday makers can both spare their bucks when traveling in Cambodia. Hostels can cost as little as $3.50 per night; and many boutique hotels offer beautifully decorated rooms with modern luxuries, and swimming pools from $65 per night for 2 people sharing. Cambodia is rich in culture and history, with many iconic historical sites, such as the Angkor Wat Archaeological Park, which is a UNESCO World heritage site, and has been declared an official Wonder of the World. At $63, the three-day ticket to the park is a bit pricier in comparison to other costs in Cambodia, but when spread out over the three days, it works out to be well worth it – there are so many temples to see, and a one day pass is a bit short to see it all.

2. India
India has always been a favorite for travelers on a budget, and there are very few countries in the world that you can travel so broadly and eat so well for such a low cost. The temple town of Gokarna has spectacular beaches that could contend with the best in the world, and also features sacred sites like Mahabaleshwar Temple, which has a shrine dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva. At Mumbai’s street markets and stalls, you will find the most amazing kebabs and other authentic Indian food. The Golden City of Jaisalmer offers you the adventure of a lifetime, where you can explore the sands of the Thar Desert, which seem to go on forever. Even when traveling first class on trains, and using taxi services, you enjoy a budget holiday for as little as $20 per day, including your accommodation in a hostel, transport, and food, as long as you eat the local meals.

1. Vietnam
Vietnam should be on the top of everyone’s budget travel list. With its vivid landscapes, rich history, amazing food and lively energy, Vietnam will astonish you, grabbing you from all angles, simultaneously energetic and tranquil. Vietnam most amazing asset is its inspiring countryside – from the limestone karst topography to the waterways and  fields, with beautiful beaches and busy cities spotted in between. Vietnam also has some of the best cuisine in the world, where you can enjoy a bowl authentic pho for as little as $2 while getting to know the locals. Although Vietnam has risen in popularity as a top tourist destination in the last decade, most of the country is left undeveloped and unchanged, and is the best destination for budget traveling. You can easily enjoy the verdant mountains and stunning white sandy beaches while spending very little money. As little as $13 per day will cover your accommodation in a guest house, local food, travel costs, and drinks, such as Bai Hoi, Vietnam’s most well-known which costs less than $1.",travel

395,S0TemlxiMd,Learn to travel -- travel to learn: Robin Esrock at TEDxVancouver,"Robin Esrock's success as a global adventurer, travel writer, TV producer and international TV personality was no accident, although it did start with one. Struck down on his bike at a Vancouver intersection, Robin hobbled away with a broken kneecap, and one year later, a modest $20,000 insurance settlement. It was just enough for him pack up his things, quit his job, and set off on a one-year solo round-the-world backpacking adventure to 24 countries. He named his journey Modern Gonzo, and committed to record his year of living dangerously, with online weekly reports, photography, videos, and interviews with every person he met. In doing so, he pioneered a new era of multi-platform, switched-on and wired-in travel journalism, leading to adventures beyond his wildest dreams.

We had 3 days in Milan so we hit the ground running and tried to see and do as much as possible. We made time for major attractions like Il Duomo, Sforza Castle, and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, but we also veered away from the crowds in search of street art and interesting neighborhoods. This being Italy, we also tried to prioritize meals, sampling everything from pizza to risotto, and cappuccinos to aperitivos. The following travel guide will highlight 20 things to do when you visit Milan, Italy

1) Milan Catherdral (Il Duomo - Duomo di Milano - Domm de Milan)

5) The Galleria - Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II 
6) Risotto alla Milanese - Milan style risotto
7) Street Art around Porta Ticinese 
8) Colonne di San Lorenzo - Columns of San Lorenzo Roman Ruins

Our trip to Milan, Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities, museums, restaurants, arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.

20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Our first stop was Il Duomo, which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.

So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.

Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan, and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions, including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.

For some upscale designer shopping, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.

So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.

The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.

Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city’s canal system.

Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco. 

So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.

And that's all for our visit to Milan. We hope this video will give you some cool ideas of sights and attractions to check out.

This is part of our Travel in Italy series showcasing Italian culture, Italian arts, Italian foods & Italian cuisine.

401,lqSoLVkYYu0,Traveling Iran by train | DW Documentary,"Iran is opening its doors to foreigners and a train ride from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea is a great way to get to know the country and its people.

The travel restrictions that are now being lifted were in place for decades. Many Iranians are hoping they will now be able to lead a freer life – and we meet many of these hospitable and welcoming people on our journey through the Middle Eastern nation. 

The country’s most important rail link, the Trans-Iranian Railway, runs for approximately 1400 kilometers from the Persian Gulf via Teheran to the Caspian Sea. The journey starts in Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab, the river border between Iraq and Iran.

Traveling past oil fields, the train reaches Shushtar. One of the top sights here is the historic hydraulic system, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After that, the train heads up into the Zagros Mountains. The journey is interrupted by a break for prayer. Breath-taking landscapes move past the train window until we reach the highest point not only of our journey but of the entire rail network: 2,200 meters above sea level between Dorud and Arak.

During a brief stop in Qom, travelers can refuel with sohan, a pastry made of wheat germ, flour and sugar. The next section of the track is high-speed and we continue on to Teheran at 160 km/h. The metropolitan area is home to more than 15 million people. The last leg takes us to the north of the country.

In the Alborz Mountains, we find out what role the Trans-Iranian Railway played during Stalin’s major offensive against the German army in World War II. Our oriental rail adventure ends in Bandar-e Torkaman on the Caspian Sea.

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it’s one of the best places I have ever ever visited. 

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver’s clean air is thanks to it’s really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn’t just a place, it’s a way of life. But it’s a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we’re going to help you make the most of it! We’re going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let’s get from the airport. 

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward – a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. 

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain – it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here’s what you need to know:

Now it’s not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There’s ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn’t too bad in our experience.",travel

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

I'm traveling light, it's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light, like we used to do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Good night, good night, my fallen star
I guess you're right, you always are
I know you're right about the blues
You live some life you'd never choose
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who
Forgot to dream of the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light, like we used to do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Traveling light, it's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light' like we used to do

But if the road leads back to you
Must I forget the things I knew
When I was friends with one or two
Traveling light like we used to do
I'm traveling light

410,4z6RZXv5p8,,"Is interstellar travel doomed to remain in the realm of science fiction? Sticking to near future space propulsion only, how close can we get to the speed of light?

This video looks at the current spacecraft speed records with Apollo 10 holding the record for the fastest manned spacecraft, New Horizons probe for the fastest Earth escape velocity and the Helios probes for the fastest heliocentric velocity. But Solar Probe Plus will beat that when it launches in 2018. While Voyager 1 doesn't set any speed records, it was the first spacecraft to leave the solar system, so therefore the fastest solar system escape velocity by default.

For beating these speeds, this video explores what is possible in the near future only, so no antimatter, Alcubierre drives (warp), ramjets, etc... The EM drive is left out until it's proven with actual reproducible results in space.

Project Daedalus and the updated Project Icarus represent sound concepts for fusion spacecraft. IKAROS was the first successful demonstration of solar sail technology but hopefully the planetary society is not far behind with their LightSail cubsat (not covered in this video).

But what appears to have the most potential to reach the nearest star to our own, Proxima Centauri and it's newly discovered planet Proxima b is Breakthrough Starshot. Thousands of super lightweight laser sail nanocraft will be launched into space then the light beamer, a ground based laser array will propel these spacecraft to 20% light speed within minutes.

413,X2LxnQ,Travel Deep Inside a Leaf - Annotated Version | California Academy of Sciences,"Please turn on subtitles with the CC (Closed Captions) button to see the explanatory annotations designed for educators.

Transcript of closed captions:

0:05: We are approaching a redwood tree. To animate a scientifically accurate leaf, artists studied the texture of a redwood leaf specimen on a glass slide at high resolution. They even counted the stomata, and used that exact count for this film!

0:25: These leaves would be measured on a centimeter scale. Throughout the animation, we will gradually zoom in to smaller scales.

0:40: As we approach a single stoma, we are now on a millimeter scale.

0:48: As we enter the interior of the leaf, we see many individual palisade cells.  These cells are where photosynthesis takes place; they are translucent to allow sunlight to enter.  

1:00: As we approach a single palisade cell, we’ll zoom down to the micrometer scale.  The shapes inside the cell are organelles: the bright globules at the bottom are the Golgi apparatus; the yellow spotted tubes are endoplasmic reticulum studded with ribosomes.  

1:09: That large, blue membrane surrounds the nucleus; the purple blobs are mitochondria.

1:18: The faint, yellow, spider-web structure of the cytoskeleton provides structure and support to the cell.

1:24:  You are about to enter a chloroplast; inside you see flat, pancake-like membranous structures called thylakoids.  This is where the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place to produce ATP, the cell’s energy carrier molecule. way


1:38:  The time scale has changed:  the molecules are shown moving 1 million times slower than in real life!

1:42: As we near an individual thylakoid, the animation scale continues to shrink down to the molecular level, where things are measured in nanometers.


1:52: The green and blue bush-like structures are photosystems: clusters of proteins that absorb light energy from the sun and help convert it into the chemical energy that’s stored in the bonds of the energy carrier molecule called ATP.

2:03: The yellow-green, rotating structure is an enzyme called ATP synthase.  This molecular machine facilitates the flow of protons down their concentration gradient from one side of the thylakoid membrane to the other, using the energy released in the process to assemble ATP.  

2:16: The pulses of light in the thylakoid membrane in which the photosystems are embedded represent energized electrons being passed from one photosystem to another, passing along the energy which will be stored in the bonds of ATP (the classic “bucket brigade”).

2:26: The small “wigglies” are ATP molecules.  Living things store energy in the bonds of the ATP molecules and then use that energy to conduct all the processes of life.  

This animation is a model, and has its strengths and limitations. In order to model something well, visual artists have to make decisions about what to represent and how best to do so. What’s present in this model, and what’s intentionally missing or altered? Find out by visiting

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

24 Hours in London Travel Guide Video Transcript:

London. Like many world capitals, this is a city that never sleeps, and on my most recent visit, I got to experience that firsthand. My challenge was to discover 24 unique experiences in London – one for every hour of the day! 

From secret speakeasies to living room concerts, and whimsical afternoon teas to bustling food markets, I scoured the city to bring you the following 24 hours in London! Let’s begin. 

I skipped breakfast to visit a coffee shop in Hampstead!

With a bit of caffeine in my system, I continued on to my 9:00 am activity which was walking up Parliament Hill in Hampstead Heath with a great lookout point of the city skyline. 

Set in a former power station it is home to the national collection of British art from 1900 to the present.

I got off at Westminster Station and walked over to Horse Guards Parade for my next activity. 

If you’re visiting with kids there’s a section inside the museum where you can try on different uniforms.

Cruising down the Thames is a classic way to experience London while hearing interesting London facts that you won’t find in any guidebook.

With hundreds of food stalls selling everything.

What can you do in the middle of the afternoon in London? I made my way over to the West End for a show.

Having afternoon tea at the Sanderson was like stumbling down a rabbit hole and being transported to the world of Alice in Wonderland. Everything from the menu to the teapots to the ‘drink me’ potions was just right!

The RISEGallery has been doing a lot of work to help connect local artists with property owners, and this has resulted in some beautiful murals. 

I attended my first Late where museums and art galleries stay open after hours, offering extended admission or putting on special events.

I got to experience Sofar Sounds, which is a pop-up concert that takes place in people’s living rooms. It’s not until 24 hours before the event that you are emailed the address and the names of the artists performing that night. 

Then at 11pm, for a bit of live music, it was onwards to The Blues Kitchen in Brixton, where they do barbecue, bourbon, and blues.

Flight Club is a bar that puts a twist on the traditional English pub by adding modern darts into the equation.

With the clock striking one, my next stop transported me to London in the 1940s. 

This bar was set in an attic and it had a bit of speakeasy vibe. There mixing all sorts of fun cocktails.

We checked out London’s nightlife scene at 3 am with dance moves at KOKO.

Last but not least, the final activity of my 24 hours in London was breakfast at Duck & Waffle. Located on a 40th floor, this restaurant has amazing views of Central London and they are open 24 hours a day. 

And that’s a wrap for my 24 hours in London! I hope you enjoyed following along and that also got a few ideas for your own trip. As you can see, this city has plenty to offer, no matter the time of day. Wishing you happy travels and see you next time!

440,R6ZkycLxV0E,,"http://tourvideos.com/  The world's most deluxe country.
Passing through Eze sur Mer, but were not stopping because we are heading to Monaco, the world's second-smallest country, after the Vatican, less than a square mile in size.  It's been a sovereign nation since 1861 when it gained independence from France, and it's a full member of the United Nations -- small, but filled with beautiful contrast, one of the world's most deluxe places.
The Tourist Information office in the train station is a great place to stop and pick up some brochures and you can get a free city map here and you'll find they are very helpful.
And yet despite this diminutive size, there is contrast in Monaco:  You've got the Old Town and you've got the new ultra-modern town...you've got the waterfront and you've got the hillside...there are beautiful flowers and gardens and historic sites.
This program will focus on the two main areas for the visitor:  The old town and Monte Carlo with the casino and elegant shopping area.
Monaco is more than twice as densely populated as the second most crowded country, which is Singapore.That's with a population density in Monaco of about 47,000 people per square mile, compared to Singapore with about 20,000 people per square mile.
Now this is really crowded compared to other European countries.  For example, the UK has got about 700 people per square mile, Italy 500 people per square mile.  So we are talking about a very crowded and packed in place, this Monaco, and yet they manage it amazingly well.  Perhaps this is a model for the other big cities of the world, showing how to grow and how to plan your city.
Several cities in the world have got twice the population density of Monaco, including Dacca, the most crowded city in the world, the capital of Bangladesh, Manila and Mumbai.  Other cities that are more crowded include in India, Delhi and Calcutta, also Hong Kong, and Paris is more densely populated; Bogotá, Karachi, Cairo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai, Manila and even Paris.  And yet Monaco does a very good job of organizing the people who live here into beautiful buildings and lovely neighborhood, so they're doing a great job in handling that population.  The might even be considered a model for the rest of the urbanizing areas of the world.
Monaco gained its independence back and 1489, and had a protectorate with Spain for about 100 years and, and then with France, and then with Sardinia up until 1860.
Monaco became independent from France in 1861.
And today it's a sovereign nation represented in the United Nations.
It's surrounded by France and there is a military arrangement where it's defended by France.
Monaco is quite active on the international scene with consulates in 72 different countries, and within Monaco, there are 65 countries that have embassies, along with 75 nations with consular offices, so this is by no means a small, isolated place.  It's very much part of Europe.
The economy will surprise you.  You might think that all of the revenues are gained from the gambling casino and related gambling ventures, but actually gambling represents only 3% of the nation's revenue of the nation's revenue, the GDP.
The present casino was first inaugurated in 1863 and gradually grew an expanded ever since.  It's an elaborate structure with the principal façade fronting the town in the south façade overlooking the sea.  The earliest portion was rebuilt in 1878 by Charles Garnier, the architect of the grand opera house in Paris.
Of course gambling was very important back in the 19th century when it was just getting started.  The first casino was opened in 1856.
The principal entrance of the casino is between two towers with domes of colored tiles, and flanked by statues of the Seine and the Mediterranean.
The south façade has three arcades with Venetian mosaics and two slender towers, and niches at the side with statues representing music and dance.
To arrive on the terraces of Monte Carlo at twilight on a springtime or autumn evening is one of the great episodes in one's life.",travel

444,AUfF8UVAdI,How to Use the Tokyo Subway | JAPAN TRAVEL GUIDE,"In this video, I show you everything you need to know in order to use the Tokyo Metro System effectively. It can be complex and intimidating if it's your first time in Tokyo, so hopefully this video will simplify it for you, from buying tickets to finding your destination. Don't be scared of Tokyo Subway! It's probably one of the world's most efficient transportation systems, and can get you anywhere! This is the first video of my Japan Guide series, so stay tuned for more tips and tricks for traveling/moving to Tokyo, Japan!

I have people asking how to calculate their fare for a specific trip, you can use Google Maps which tells you the single ticket fare, so you will pay 5-10Yen less if you are using an IC card. You can also use Tokyo Metro's calculator which tells you all different fares but only available for Tokyo Metro lines (so excluding TOEI/JR lines): 

EXTRA INFO YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:

Day Pass Prices (prices as of the day this video was upload
Tokyo-Metro-Only 24h Pass - 600 Yen
Tokyo Metro & Toei 1-day Pass - 1000 Yen
Everything 1-day Pass - 1590 Yen
TOURIST-ONLY Tokyo Metro & Toei Passes - 800 Yen for 24h, 1200 Yen for 48h & 1500 Yen for 72h (available for purchase at Haneda & Narita Airports, select BIC CAMERA stores, travel agencies, etc. More about this pass: )

TIPS FOR SAVING $$$
1. Stick to Tokyo Metro lines only - these 9 lines should get you to all touristic destinations (some may require slightly longer transit time, but it won't be much longer than the more expensive route)
2. Avoid buses if you are just traveling - they are expensive and doesn't provide free transfer to metro
3. Buy a combo pass if you arrive from Narita or Haneda Airport, they can save you a lot of money. More info: 
4. Group together sights that can only be accessed by subway within the time period limited by the 24h/48h/72h metro pass. Go to sights that are accessible by foot on other days

446,xycecbwpIzE,Travelling With a Physical Disability in Japan,"Part 2: Living in Japan with a Physical Disability https://youtu.be/xycecbwpIzE

Many people are aware that Japan has excellent public transportation. If you're a keen observer, you may have noticed the many wheelchair accessible facilities, but perhaps have not seen physically disabled people make use of them. In this video, Yuriko Oda (Wheelchair Walker) and Josh Grisdale (Accessible Japan) show what it's like to travel with a physical disability in Japan's trains, buses, cars, taxis, and planes. 

This is part of new series of social documentaries about Japan that I'm making. Future episodes will attempt to answer questions like: what are the living conditions of the homeless, what does social housing look life and how affordable is housing, what is it like to work in Japan and is there any work/life balance, and what is it like to go to primary school?

If you'd like to support these types of social documentaries, I now have a Patreon account . Any support at all will be greatly appreciated!

Both Yuriko and Josh post great information about accessibility in Japan, and you can find them at:

Travel video about destination Austria.
Austria has much to offer: high mountains and alpine pastures in the west, Mediterranean lakes in the south and scenic plains in the east. A land of majestic buildings and of the rural culture and history of past centuries.For more than three hundred years Vienna was the residence of the emperor and the nobility had their fine palaces built in this city that was dominated by Baroque architecture. The Hofburg was the residence of the royal family and the legislative centre of the city, with eighteen wings, nineteen courtyards and more than two and a half thousand rooms. The mighty central cupola of the National Library spans thirty metres high above the most beautiful reading hall in the world and each day white Lipizzaner stallions are trained in the Spanish Riding School. The Wachau covers thirty six kilometres of the Danube Delta with mediaeval old towns, castles and ruins, a Baroque monastery and an ancient vine growing culture. Linz is the capital of Upper Austria and is a dynamic industrial city with an old town that has a long history. It is the third largest city in Austria and is located on both banks of the Danube with several connecting bridges. Salzburg is a city of bishops and of music and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Austria as well as being the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The Grossglockner High Alps Road travels through one of the greatest natural landscapes in the world, the Hohe Tauern National Park, a remarkable mountain world in which nature is at its most glorious. Although this former powerful realm of the Habsburger is now a relatively small country, its history, traditions and the diversity of its remarkable landscapes have retained their irresistible allure. Austria will always be the majestic land in the very heart of Europe!

451,2CyfAdTNM,9 Travel Outfit Ideas (Wear This Not That),"Today I will share 9 travel outfit ideas for the airplane.  I am going to show you a piece of clothing and say, ""Wear this not that."" I will help you know what to wear and what not to wear when you travel.  How you dress in an airplane will help you be more comfortable in your outfit.  You will worry less about stains, you will be at ease when you are sitting and bending over, and you will not be self conscious about what you are wearing. Since we are an airline family, I have come up with 9 travel outfit pieces that will help you know to wear this and not that on the airplane.
The number 1 travel outfit idea is to wear one with a Cardigan Not a Poncho - Cardigans add dimension to your travel outfit, they add layering if you get cold, they add length to your body, cardigans can mix and match with your travel outfits while on vacation, cardigans with pockets give you added function in an airport, like a place to store your phone when you have to pay for a coffee. Cardigans can be light weight or heavy for warmth.  Let me know if you agree with all nine  ideas.

458,Em4lbLf09M0,How to Pack Clothes for Traveling 👕💼,"When traveling it's important to pack efficiently, organized and smart. I show a method to roll your clothing into a tight bundle that makes it compact and easy to transport. Rolling your clothes is a great way to prevent wrinkles and conserve space. When you roll clothing you can fit more than you can normally by folding or just placing clothes into your luggage bag. This can also be used for things other than traveling such as any time you are moving clothing and want to conserve space. The same method can be used on other clothes that I did not demonstrate such a shorts. Which are rolled the same way the pants were rolled. Small items of clothing such as socks and underwear can be placed on top of a T-shirt and rolled up inside the shirt.

If you enjoy the channel, please support Von Malegowski:
- 

The clothes rolling technique may seem like it takes longer than simply folding the clothes but if you do it more you will become more proficient and see that it really doesn't take much longer and produces better results. 

If you are worried about wrinkling your clothing you can unpack them when you reach your destination and they shouldn't have any wrinkles yet. If your clothes do have wrinkles I have a video about removing wrinkles from clothes without an iron 👕( which shows some easy methods of removing wrinkles.

Clothing Traveling Tips: Some simple tips to help you pick suitable clothing for traveling.

#1: When choosing your clothing for a trip, look at each item’s fabric and consider the following factors: quality, thickness, weight, wrinkles, transparency, and texture. Ideal travel clothing is durable, takes up minimal space and weight, is wrinkle-free, opaque, and matches with the rest of your clothing in style and fit.

#2: Be aware of your color palette when selecting clothing. If your color palettes are cross compatible, you will have many outfits from less clothing. 

#3: Most places you go will have much of what you need. You can buy almost anything, anywhere in the world. So you can get away with only packing half of what you think you’ll need. 

#4: Versatile, low-maintenance clothing is important when packing light. Consider 5 factors that make an article of clothing desirable when traveling and aim to have each piece you bring satisfy at least 3 of them. 
- Comfortable for touring around, but can be dressed up for the evening 
- Is appropriate for cool or warm weather 
- Doesn’t show stains 
- Folds up small 
- Coordinates well with almost everything else you’re bringing 
By doing this you maximize the usage of each article of clothing so you can bring less. 

#5: If you’re traveling for longer than 7 days only pack enough clothes for 7 days, no matter how long you’re traveling for. It’s easier to find a Laundromat once a week then carry around the extra weight of more clothing than is necessary. 

#6: Avoid clothing that is too bulky and may take up too much space and Instead of bringing a bulky jacket, bring a light jacket and dress in layers.    

#7: A long sleeve and a short sleeve button shirt will work well for most places you travel to as well as some T-shirts.     

#8: Roll your clothing efficiently to allow for more space. Using the method I demonstrate can save a lot of space and allow you to pack lighter.

459,KoH2bU9xADg,"The people, history and culture of Uzbekistan - Traveling the Silk Road | DW Documentary","With its magical buildings, fascinating landscapes and friendly people, Uzbekistan has a lot to offer. It is a country caught between rich traditions and modernity.

Wild equestrian games, fairytale palaces and hospitable people proud of their magnificent culture - all this will be encountered by those traveling through Uzbekistan on the Silk Road. The central Asian country borders Kazakhstan to the north and Afghanistan to the south. The journey begins in Samarkand, one of central Asia’s oldest cities.

For centuries cities like Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva provided the necessary infrastructure for the caravans on the Silk Road, allowing merchants to trade their goods and providing accommodation for them and their animals. Many buildings still survive to underline the splendor and wealth that trade once generated. In Samarkand, one of the world’s oldest cities, three outstanding Koran schools, known as madrasas, on Registan Square have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the Boysun region in the Hissar Mountains the ancient, and none-too-gentle riding game known as Kopkari is held at Nowruz, the New Year festival. More than a hundred horsemen try to pick up the body of a dead goat from the ground and to escape with this from all the others. In 1380 the Uzbek folk hero Amir Timur (Tamerlane) had the gigantic Ak Sarav, the White Palace, built in Shahrisabz, the town of his birth. It had a thousand rooms adorned with gemstones.

You can use your oyster card or contactless payment card for lots of different types of transport on London TFL services. This includes buses, trains, tubes, Thames Clipper boats, trams and even the Emirates Airline cable cars. 
My favourite thing to do is to travel on the old Number 15 routemaster buses. A real icon of London. I'll show you all the tips and tricks on how to behave like a true Londoner and not to be barged out of the way by the locals when travelling on transport in London. 
There are other ways to pay for London Transport including Apple Pay on your iphone or with a contactless credit or debit card. But I think it's easiest to get an oyster card when you first arrive. Try to avoid buying paper tickets because they cost more!! And the buses don't accept money so you must have an oyster or credit card or apple pay.

492,zhtg9XgVwuM,Edinburgh Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The Scottish capital of Edinburgh is one of the world’s most beautiful cities. Its Old Town and Royal Mile are filled with the ghosts of medieval merchants, body snatchers, and poets, while its Georgian-styled New Town shines with the glories of the Scottish Enlightenment.  

To see Edinburgh in all her glory, climb to Arthur’s Seat, the highest of the city’s seven peaks. Some historians believe this was the site of King Arthur’s legendary castle Camelot.
 
Nearby, on another volcanic crag, rises Edinburgh Castle, the very symbol of Scotland itself. Over the last eleven centuries, this castle has been laid siege to 26 times but still it stands, a testimony to the indomitable spirit of the Scots.
 
Edinburgh has long held a special place in the hearts of the monarchy. Her Majesty’s Yacht Britannia sailed over one million miles before being permanently moored at Ocean Terminal as a symbol of the Royal Family’s affection for the people of Edinburgh.  
 
Edinburgh has been the jewel in the crown of royals for centuries and its old-world chivalry continues today. Thistle Chapel, in St Giles’ Cathedral, honors the Knights and Ladies of Scotland’s oldest order.
 
In Princes Street Gardens, rises the world’s largest monument to a writer, dedicated to Sir Walter Scott. At the Writers Museum, learn about more of Scotland’s cherished literary adventurers. Edinburgh casts her spell over contemporary writers too, JK Rowling wrote two of her Harry Potter series in cozy Old Town nooks, such as the Elephant House Café.
 
For centuries, the University of Edinburgh has given us intellectual giants such as Charles Darwin, David Hume and Alexander Bell. Explore centuries of innovation at the Scottish Museum, or head to South Queensferry to see the Forth Bridge, an engineering marvel when it opened in 1890.

The Royal Botanic Gardens is one of the world’s oldest and most important centers of botanical science, yet it’s still a place which invites one to slow down.
 
Edinburgh is a city that has given the world countless gifts, but perhaps her greatest is showing that all parts of the human experience - the sciences and the arts, the past and the present, the sacred and the light-hearted - all have equal value.

Amsterdam is the largest city in The Netherlands, also known as Holland. The fun-loving Dutch welcome 3.5 million tourists a year, making Amsterdam one of the top destinations in Europe.

No Amsterdam tour is complete without exploring some of its 165 canals and 1,000 bridges – hopefully you like water. Don’t worry; you don’t need a boat or even a motor vehicle to get around. The heart of this ancient city is best seen on foot or from the seat of a bicycle. This city is rich in history; when you set out to explore “The Venice of the North,” you’ll find buildings dating back to the 13th century, as well as Dam Square and its royal palace. 

If you’ve got an appreciation for fine art, your Amsterdam sightseeing should pause at the Rijksmuseum, where you can find the works of Rembrandt and other Dutch masters. Up for a pint? Stop by the old Heineken Brewery and learn about the lager brewing process. If you’re really feeling daring, grab a coffee in De Wallen, better known as one of the world’s oldest red light districts. You won’t get into trouble with your partner if you head there these days; it’s now home to cafes and adult stores.

496,7dilTLvbHx,Washington D.C. Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Washington.d17...

Take in the many splendors of the nation’s capital when you arrive at Washington, D.C.

Your Washington, D.C. tour should start at the National Mall, where you’ll find monuments, memorials, and government buildings instead of tons of shopping. If you’d like to get around town easily but don’t want to rent a car, the Capital Bikeshare program will let you cruise around the city without wasting gas or getting stuck in traffic.

Check out the Watergate Hotel and Kennedy Center when you stop at Foggy Bottom, then move on to Georgetown, the oldest district in D.C. It’s filled with 18th-century buildings and, of course, the university itself. After a stop at the National Cathedral, make your way to the Smithsonian National Zoo, the perfect stop for the young and the young at heart.

If you’re feeling the need to channel your inner 007, go to the International Spy Museum, and learn about the covert operations and intelligence agencies that have shaped the world we live in. Of course, you can’t enjoy any Washington, D.C., tourism without admiring the White House, so make sure that’s on your list too.

503,GwFFPnhuN6Y,Ireland Travel,"Ireland travel is about taking a journey into the magical.  The rugged beauty of the land is matched only by the hospitality of the people. While taking a tour of Ireland you should always include time to travel West Cork.

Many people travel Ireland to have a unique experience.  Whether you go to see the jagged coastline pounded under the relentless power of the Atlantic Ocean, walk the paths, climb the rocky hills, fish from a quiet pier, sit on a sandy beach, take photographs of the Irish countryside or cycle the winding roads; a visit to the scenic area of West Cork is a must. 

For those interested in Ireland travel deals and tips, you will have no trouble finding something to suit you.  One travel deal/tip you may not know about concerns the pub.  If you are traveling with kids and don't want to buy soda, you can ask for tap water with flavored fruit syrups.  This will save about $3 per small bottle of Coke or Pepsi, and the kids will enjoy it too!

 There are many Ireland travel packages available on-line.  The types of trips available are really only limited by what you want.  Many of the packages include all the things you need to enjoy your trip including air travel, car hire and lodging.  These packages can be booked to cover a few days or even weeks.

Begin your tour of West Cork at Mizen Head, Ireland's most southwesterly point.  The dramatic peninsula features Barley Cove beach and is highlighted by the Mizen Head Signal Station Visitor Centre.  Be sure to look for seals lazily resting on the rocks below.

The best pub in the entire world is located in the small village of Crookhaven.  As you walk into O'Sullivan's Bar, the owner, Dermot O'Sullivan, will greet you with a friendly, ""Hello boys and girls.""  What happens if you try to order a Guinness?  You don't want to know.  Go with the Murphy's; it's local and creamier!

Possibly the most beautiful place in all of West Cork is Three Castle Head.  The collection of three towers, built in 1207 by the O'Mahoneys, is a short hike from Dunlough Pier.  The castles sit on cliffs, which offer views of the Atlantic Ocean, Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and the mountains of County Kerry.  At the base of the castles is a lake.  Irish legend holds that a lady haunts the lake while protecting the king's valuables that were thrown in to guard them from attackers.

Between the villages of Goleen and Durrus, you will find the Coast Road.  On this road is the well-preserved O'Mahoney Castle known as Dunmanus Castle.  The castle was built in 1430 at the current location of Dunmanus Harbor.  Views of the beautiful Irish countryside and Dunmanus Bay will have you reaching for your camera.

Further along, near the village of Skibbereen is the area of Lough Hyne.  Lough Hyne is a salt-water lake, fed by the tides, and is home to a varied collection of marine life.  Above the lake are the walking paths of Knockamagh Wood Nature Reserve.  The paths of the nature preserve lead you to commanding views of Roaringwater Bay, Baltimore harbor and Clear and Sherkin Islands. 

Up the coast, near the County Kerry border, is the fishing village of Castletownbere. The village is situated on the southern edge of the Beara Peninsula and is near the beginning of the southern portion of the Ring of Beara.  Just out of town are the ruins of Dunboy Castle, which was destroyed by the English in 1602 after a 14-day siege.

Leaving the West Cork area, head up to Bantry Bay, through Glengarriff and Kenmare up to the pride of County Kerry, Killarney.  The town of Killarney is filled with a nice mix of nature and history.  A visit to the Muckross area; including the house, abbey and gardens is very enjoyable.  You can easily spend a full day taking in this incredible area.  So, what is the best part of it all?  You only have to park once as all these sites are within walking distance of each other.

If you are heading back to Dublin, a stop in Cashel is very enjoyable.  The Rock of Cashel is world-famous and awe inspiring.  A little known abbey in Cashel is Hore Abbey that sits at the bottom of the hill in the shadows of the Rock of Cashel.  Hore Abbey will be less crowded and will allow peaceful exploring without crowds.

504,72fWNqJD4,,"Travel video about destination Yehliu.
In the north of Taiwan close to the second largest harbour in Keelung is one of the world's greatest natural wonders. Due to its bizarre rock formations, Yehliu Park provides visitors with scenery that could be from a distant planet. But the polymorphic shapes of the rock are not extraterrestrial but the result of an ancient process that dates back several million years, erosion.Some of the rocks seem to grow out of the ground like giant mushrooms. The reason for this lies in the composition of the rock strata. The more elevated sections are often far harder and weatherproof than the lower layers that crumble away and have been transformed into gravel and sand.In 1964 the Yehliu Peninsula was officially designated as a park and since then it has been one of Taiwan's most important and popular tourist attractions. The park consists of a total area of around fifty three hectares of land and more than four hundred hectares of coast. Its rocky terrain flanks the South China Sea.The Queen's Head is Yehliu's world famous landmark. But even this amazing natural work of art shows sign of ageing. However, Yehliu will still be known as an outstanding wonder of nature, as wind, salt and water continue to sculpt its scenery and thus create further spectacular and imaginative rock formations for future generations to come.

507,7U8mGgjj6yY,,"https://www.aswetravel.com/impression... Sri Lanka In 4 Mins - As We Travel: Asia - 

We’ve arrived in Sri Lanka, and after spending a few crazy days in Colombo, we’re now down in the beautiful beach town of Hikkaduwa where we’ve spent the last few days surfing, relaxing and enjoying the amazing lifestyle here. The beaches are beautiful, the nature’s amazing. You could really spend months just hanging around here. However, we’ve only got three weeks to see the whole country, so tomorrow we’re heading off to Galle, one of the best examples of fortified cities built by Europeans in South and Southeast Asia. Walking around Galle, you can really see the influence Europeans had on the city. There’s Dutch, Portuguese, and British architecture everywhere. You can also find cute little tea houses, art galleries mixed with traditional Asian culture. We’re up nice and early and took a tuk tuk ride from Galle to Unawatuna, which is one of the most famous and beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka. We’re going to have a look around and then have some breakfast by the beach. 

We’ve arrived in Ella, a cute little town up in the Sri Lankan Hill Country. It’s really beautiful here. It’s green, it’s lush, it’s absolutely amazing. We’re right in the middle of a tea plantation, and the best thing to go do here is to go trekking and enjoy these amazing views that you see behind me. We’re in Nuwara Eliya, an area in the Hill Country of Sri Lanka also known as Little Britain because of its typical British climate and British architecture. It’s a very popular place for Sri Lankans to visit during the holidays to get away from the heat. And one of the most popular things to do here is to walk among the tea plantations and, of course, drink some tea. We’ve arrived at Summit of Adam’s Peak. I’m absolutely freezing. We started 2 o’clock this morning, and it was pretty hard work to get to the top here. But it’s really, really beautiful up here now. We just missed the sunrise because it was cloudy, but the clouds are clearing now and you can get a really nice view down to the valley. It’s pretty amazing how high up we are. It’s also pretty incredible how many people are coming up here in the morning. It was absolutely packed, about a thousand of us walking really slow up these really, really steep stairs. It was pretty amazing, but it’s also pretty cold, so we’re going to head back down and head to Kandy next. 

Well we survived Adam’s Peak, and after a few days rest, we arrived in Kandy which is the spiritual and cultural capital of Sri Lanka. It was the last place to be conquered by the British, and because of that, they preserved a lot of their traditions and culture. So we’re going to have a look around town, explore the streets, the markets and the beautiful nature, which is right in the middle of town. So we’re finishing up our trip in Negombo, a fishing village by the airport. We had a really amazing trip in Sri Lanka. The nature’s been absolutely beautiful, the beach has been incredible, and the people are really, really friendly and really welcoming. So many things to see, so many things to do. We’re definitely going to have to come back here again. But tomorrow, we’re off to Malaysia.",travel

509,ndxssbwwGZU,SCARIEST Bridges And Roads You Can Travel On,"Roads and bridges are things that are used to travel more efficiently from place to place. They certainly help when it comes to crossing water or great heights between mountains, although those same traits also make these passages absolutely terrifying. These are the Scariest Bridges And Roads You Can Travel On. We wouldn’t recommend going to any of them. Just trust us. 

Subscribe to Talltanic 

#8 - Zhangjiajie Glass Walk Bridge
Just a year ago, China opened a breathtaking glass skywalk that had been added to Hunan’s mountainous landscapes. The winding bridge is 1,410 feet long and, as you can see from these frightening photos, it hovers 984 feet above the ground. This would be the very last place in the world you would find us. You’re on your own if you want to go check this scary bridge out. 

#7 - Lake Pontchartrain Causeway
You might be able to guess why the bridge in this picture made it into this video just by looking at it. It’s not particularly high, and it actually only sits 16 feet above the water. The bridge connects the two Louisiana towns of Metairie and Mandeville. It stretches an incredible 24 miles across the lake. If that wasn’t scary enough, once you get about eight miles into the bridge, you no longer have a visual of land. 

#6 - Captain William Moore Bridge 
Although the bridge in this photo isn’t all that scary to look at, once you find out about the surroundings and the structural integrity of this bridge, you might just change your mind. This bridge is located in Alaska and it crosses over an ACTIVE earthquake fault. The engineers who designed the bridge planned for the potential disaster and only anchored one end of the bridge securely. Now, when the ground trembles and shifts, the bridge won’t just be torn apart. However, we want to know how it’s still safe with only one end secured. How does that work?


#5 - Millau Viaduct, France
The bridge in this picture gives us the same thrilling fear as riding a roller coaster. The bridge pictured here is the Millau Viaduct located in France. The tallest part of the bridge, from the valley floor to tip of the mast is 1,125 feet tall, which is taller than the Eiffel Tower! It may be less than two miles in length, but this is another path we just aren’t going to bother taking. 

#4 - The Confederation Bridge 
This bridge located in Canada made it into this video not because it is incredibly tall and you’re scared of heights, but because it is a long eight miles to the other side. You can see just how long it is in this picture. While that in itself doesn’t seem to shiver worthy, the fact that it is the longest bridge crossing over ice cold water in the world, does. Yes, there are ones that are miles longer, but supposedly not over such freezing waters. This one billion dollar bridge probably won’t just dump you in the water as it crumbles, but that fear factor that it will is still alive and well. 


#3 - Hussaini Hanging Bridge
Hanging bridge is right! Though it should really be called “hanging by a thread bridge,” just look at the mess in this picture, someone come collect their granny, she needs help! This rickety cable and wood bridge is located in Pakistan, and you couldn’t pay us enough to cross it. The bridge crosses over the rapidly flowing Hunza River and the tattered and worn remains of the previous bridges hang right next to the one being currently used. To make this bridge that much more unbearable, it was swallowed up by flood waters in 2010. Although there has been a newer one built, it doesn't seem any safer. 


#2 - Monkey Bridges
If you told us that we would have to walk across the scary skinny bridge pictured here, we would have laughed into next week. There’s just no way. Even though this bridge seems like a joke in a movie, these “monkey” bridges are used as a quick passage in several parts of Vietnam. The name “Monkey” bridge comes from the stooped posture you have to adopt when crossing. Just so you know how crazy this bridge is, it is exactly as it looks in the picture; the bridge is made from a single bamboo log with one or two handrails. If you think crossing this is a good idea, best of luck to you and we’ll see you down at the bottom of the river, since you’re certainly falling in. 


#1 - Eshima Ohashi Bridge
This terrifying bridge wasn’t a nightmare constructed by an architect but if you looked at this picture of the bridge, you would think it was. This mile long bridge spans across Lake Nakaumi and links the city of Matsue to the city of Sakaiminato. The reason for the sudden climb in the bridge is meant to allow entire barges or ships underneath without incident. Although this bridge looks absolutely terrifying at about a 45-degree angle, it is actually not that steep, and a side view of the bridge shows that the highest point is reached with a gradual incline. It’s not at all how it appears.",travel

513,9J4a37-h9Y8,Long Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/Long-Island.d...

Long Island stretches eastward for 115 miles, from the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to the bluffs of Montauk Point.
 
Take the short train ride from Manhattan to the sands of Long Beach, which for many is where Long Island begins. From here, Long Island’s protective barrier islands continue all the way to Westhampton Island. Halfway along the chain, visit Fire Island Lighthouse, which for generations of immigrants was their first glimpse of America.
 
Many of those immigrants went on to create vast financial empires, and it was on Long Island’s northern shores where they built the mansions that would inspire F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic, The Great Gatsby.
 
At the Cradle of Aviation Museum in nearby Hempstead, discover how Long Island launched generations of aviators into the wild blue yonder. Nearby, continue your flight into the past at the American Airpower Museum.
 
In the mid 1800s, well-to-do New Yorkers were drawn to the unspoiled beaches of Long Island’s East End. Today, the pioneer settlement of Southampton Village is a place where history and style have blended as smoothly as the spirits in a Long Island Iced Tea. The past been also been beautifully preserved in nearby Sag Harbor, a historic whaling port immortalized in Moby Dick.
 
Just a 30-minute drive east from Sag Harbor is Montauk, a place locals refer to as “The End”. America’s first president, George Washington, commissioned Montauk Lighthouse on Long Island’s easternmost point. Climb to the top to take in the sweeping views of this place that has played center stage in some of America’s greatest stories.",travel

We arrive at the state of Kentucky, and visit Mammoth Cave National Park. We take the tow-hour long Domes and Dripstones tour, which takes us through the so-called ""new entrance"" to the cave. Then we continue on our journey towards Louisville, passing by Hodgenville, the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln but we don't actually visit the historical site. Instead, we stumble upon one of Abe's boyhood homes. We then continue towards Loretto, where the Maker's Mark distillery is located.

526,xNlD17wcVQ,Traveling Japan with only an instant translator | ili,"Explored Asakusa, Tokyo with ili, an instant translator! https://goo.gl/fK3cQQ
Was a very interesting and fun experience testing it out in real life travel situations :D
The one I used here was English to Japanese, however there are many other languages so check out their website for more information!

Many of you ask me if it's okay to travel to Japan even though you speak no Japanese and the simple answer is YES! With basic English and gestures you can get around Japan, however for those of you still worried about the language barrier than try out ili when you're travelling next time :)

My itinerary for this video:

Asakusa, Tokyo
- Kimono rental @Vasara
- Asakusa street food along and around Nakamise Street
- Asakusa temple @Sensōji, also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple
- Back streets of Asakusa @Hoppy Street

530,OnWGXMDhwi8,Dreamtime Travelling through the Australian continent - documentary,"Travelling through the Australian continent, one is often appalled by the living conditions of the Aborigine people. Having lost touch with their culture and traditions, many of them have become outcasts or alcoholics who aimlessly wander the streets of the Australian cities. From the early 1800s to the late 1960s, Aborigines were gradually deprived of their land by the white man who used it for herding, cropping, and mineral extraction. Forced to leave their homelands, Aborigines were often separated from their children, who were sent to live with white families or to boarding schools, in an attempt to teach them the white man’s values. Today 390,000 Aborigines account for less than 3% of the current Australian population. Learn how they are beginning to find their place in a society which has excluded them for so long. Meet and share the life of Aborigines who through art, dancing, hunting, work, or spirituality, are finding ways to better their future.

537,YziuMU2U,"Aditya 369 | Full Length Telugu Movie | Balakrishna, Mohini | TeluguOne","Aditya 369 is A Telugu Sci-fi Film Starring Nandamuri Balakrishna, Mohini in The Lead Roles. Aditya 369 Film Directed by Veteran Singeetam Srinivasa Rao and Produced by Anita Krishna on Sridevi Movies Banner, Music Composed by Illayaraja. #Aditya369  

Aditya 369 Full Length Movie Description : This movie begins with a scientist Prof. Ramdas (Tinnu Anand) doing vigorous experiments to invent a 'Time Machine' at his home laboratory. After tremendous effort eventually he becomes successful. His daughter Hema (played by Mohini) and her fiancée Krishna Kumar (Nandamuri Balakrishna) accidentally get into the time machine and visit the past (time of Krishnadeva Raya's Empire). At another instance, the couple gets ended up in a fictional 'Future' set up by the 'Time Machine' where in, the world is about to get destroyed through radiation effect after the end of Third World War. This movie has been developed and was inspired on the lines of ""back to the future"" movies but is very well made with regards to originality & regionalism. The story revolves around one more important aspect, the Krishnadeva Raya's Empire - diamond in a highly secured museum. A high profile thief Raja Verma (Amrish Puri) has a queer hobby of burglary of expensive diamonds from all over the world museums. He makes an attempt to rob the diamond in the present time, which was witnessed by a school kid - Hema's cousin (Tarun Kumar) - on his school excursion to the museum. He is trapped inside the museum and happens to see the robbery happening in front of his eyes and the kid manages to escape from the robbers and gets rescued from the museum by Krishna Kumar. The rest of the plot has many twists and turns. This contributes to the film's visual treat and laugh riot.

538,VVjMP2DPDB,Galapagos: Realm of Giant Sharks,"In the far reaches of the Galapagos archipelago there is a remote island – Darwin Island. Here, a mysterious parade of giant whale sharks passes by. All of them are pregnant females, about to give birth. What has drawn them here? Where are they going?

Galapagos: Realm of Giant Sharks follows a group of researchers who have travelled out to Darwin Island to begin following these dinosaurs of the sea wherever they travel across the globe. But placing satellite tracking devices on giant sharks is not always easy. Steel spear tips bounce off, dangerous currents intervene, and the sharks can deliver bone-crushing swipes with their tails.

In an exciting blend of science and natural history filmmaking, Galapagos: Realm of Giant Sharks uses action-packed, high-resolution photography to draw audiences into the world of one of the ocean’s largest and least understood creatures.",travel
