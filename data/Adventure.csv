Consumed by hatred for the living, Nhagruul sold his soul to the demon Lords of the abyss so that his malign spirit would survive. In an excruciating ritual, Nhagrulls skin was flayed into pages, his bones hammered into a cover, and his diseased blood became the ink to pen a book most vile. All those exposed to the book were driven to madness or so corrupted by the wicked knowledge contained within that they had no choice but to turn evil. Misery and bloodshed followed the disciples of Nhagruul as they spread their Masters dark dream. Creatures vile and depraved rose from every pit and unclean barrow to partake in the fever of destruction. The cities and kingdoms of Karkoth were consumed by this plague of evil until an order of warriors arose from the ashes. The Knights of the New Sun swore an oath to resurrect hope in the land. The purity of their hearts was so great that Pelor, the God of Light, gave the Knights powerful amulets with which to channel his power. Transcendent with divine might, the Knights of the New Sun pierced the shadow that had darkened the land for twelve hundred years and cast it asunder. But not all were awed by their glory. The disciples of Nhagruul disassembled the book and bribed three greedy souls to hide the pieces until they could be retrieved. The ink was discovered and destroyed but, despite years of searching, the cover and pages were never found. Peace ruled the land for centuries and the Knights got lost in the light of their own glory. As memory of the awful events faded so did the power of servants of Pelor. They unwittingly abandoned themselves in the incorrect belief that the Book of Vile Darkness could never again be made whole.",2012,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy            ","Anthony Howell, Dominic Mafham, Jack Derges, Kaloian Vodenicharov",Gerry Lively,2071,,4.5

Justin Time,22,"Justin Time is a Canadian animated television series for pre-school aged children, created by Brandon James Scott. The show airs on Disney Junior (both English and French) in Canada, the Sprout channel in the United States, Tiny Pop in the United Kingdom, and Kids Talk Talk Plus in South Korea. The show revolves around the adventures of Justin. In every episode, Justin encounters a real-world problem of everyday childhood (such as sharing, teamwork, or paying attention). Then Justin and his shape-shifting sidekick Squidgy solve the problems by tackling them in imaginary adventures through time and around the world. In every adventure, Justin and Squidgy meet their best friend Olive, who always lives in the place and time they are visiting, and who usually needs their help to accomplish a task. Together, the three of them encounter the same problem that Justin faces in the real world, and together they solve the problem before Justin's parents call him back to the real world. In the original concept, Justin travelled via a time machine, which led to the title ""Justin Time"".[1] Because the concept of ""the past"" is challenging for pre-schoolers, the show instead focuses on more developmentally appropriate adventures of make-believe. It is noticed that the Canadian flag is blue and white instead of its official red and white in the theme song. In November 2014 it was announced that Netflix were to create a new original spin-off series entitled 'Justin Time: The New Adventures. The spin-off will follow Justin and best friends Olive and Squidgy on more fantastical adventures around the globe, and will comprise of thirteen half-hour episodes to be released for streaming in early 2016.[2] Justin Time was nominated for a 2013 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Pre-School Animated Program,[3] and for a 2013 Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production For Preschool Children.[4] ""Brandon Scott James Blog"".

As the story progresses and Jas is recruited into the program, they both test the technology and end up in a deserted parallel reality to the one they were in. Upon returning to the original time line, Jack is trapped and remains in the parallel universe and must use his time and resources to repair his wormhole device to allow him to recreate a wormhole and travel back to the original time line. Simultaneously, the gravity strength of his reality is greater than that of Jas's reality, resulting in his biological clock ticking slower than hers. At this point Jas grows up faster than Jack does in his parallel reality. During the test runs, Jack makes contact with Older Jas (Iona Felfeli) when she is a dance teacher during one of her lessons with students. She has a subtle sense of Jack's presence and realises he is still alive. This prompts her memory to find Jack's note that she kept hidden for so long, instructing her to use the second wormhole. Jack then makes a final attempt at creating a wormhole. He successfully creates one with Older Jas's help. Together they return to the original time line after co-creating an Einstein-Rosen bridge (wormhole) together. Later on, Jack finds himself resting in a clinical setting and speaks with Agent Case about leaving the program and moving on with his life. Agent Case brings Jas in to talk with him. Jack realizes he wants to go back in time to see his parents, implying a butterfly effect, whereby him and her would never have met and the technology would no longer exist.

Stolen Seas,90,"Stolen Seas presents a chilling exploration of the Somali pirate phenomenon and forces you to rethink everything you thought you knew about pirates. It's November 8th, 2008 and the CEC Future, a Danish-owned merchant ship, is on high alert. Sailing inside the pirate-infested swath of sea between Somalia and Yemen, the ship's captain blinks hard at the radar screen where a light begins to flash. This is it, Nozhkin thinks, and he's right. Machine guns sound on the boat's hull and for two months this 13-man crew will be held at the mercy of Somali pirates, helpless as hostage negotiations threaten their lives and cameras capture every move. The pirates' translator, Ishmael Ali, a single dad who may or may not have stumbled into this controversial role, puts in a call to the shipping magnate's CEO Per Gullestrup demanding an exorbitant 7 million dollars. The shipowner's response is the first of many misfires and communications to come. These two adversaries will have to become unlikely allies as they race against time in an attempt to keep the crew from being killed by their violent captors. Stolen Seas documents the story of 13 powerless men trapped on a ship, and why their captors feel justified in their tyranny. It's the story of a Somali translator who get's in over his head -trying to give his son a chance. With first hand accounts from leading experts on the subject refuting the common misconceptions, Stolen Seas explores theories of what drives a country to piracy, from every point of view.

She infiltrates the Malas when the bar is attacked by the gang's fiercest rival, and Jaylene saves one of them from certain death. Thus our heroine is inducted into the Malas, whose sole mission is murder.

But pledging allegiance to the gang has a cost, and the Malas have their enemies: police, rival gangs, and even members of Los Muertos. The deeper Jaylene goes, the more danger she's in. Yet, she finds herself surrounded by the familial acceptance she's desperately craved her entire life.

Or the Drums of Doom, which when played in the right order can hypnotise the whole world via computers. This is the legacy of Grandpa Skinner. But these unsuspecting kids have a secret weapon - their youth.

Candide,100,"We believe that adapting Voltaire's Candide (originally published in 1759) in a free way entirely based on contemporary references, is a revolutionary mission. Not only because it is a rare take on animation as a genre, but also because - in a much entertaining way - it is a critical interpretation of the challenges imposed on core democratic values. This is a series that isn't just a visual gag or a wonderfully cheap laugh, but it also looks some very hard realities of life straight in the eye. We are convinced that there is a need among the audience to watch culturally rich, thoughtful unique animation shows, which reflect on our current situation in a satirical tone. Imagine Candide as the new show completely aware of The Amazing World of Gumball, as well as South Park, Rick and Morty or Bojack Horseman, yet with a distinguished graphic design, and characters partly 18th century partly 21st century style. Candide is a non-conventional show, it works with witty, critical thinking yet it quotes popular topics from mass media, like cutting out Rainforests, climate change and the political-financial elite, the effects of terrorism, life in warzones, unresolved immigration issues, emerging dictatorship, challenges of the high tech lifestyles, or man in space. It is made in the spirit of Voltaire, but it takes place in today's globalized world, therefore there are many ways to see ourselves in this mirror .",2018,"Animation, Action, Adventure            ",,,18,,8.0

Nowhere Boys: The 5th Boy,0,"Overview The Nowhere Boys interactive game is a unique immersive experience. Players enter through the broadcaster's online site to discover a fifth boy who, like the Nowhere Boys, is lost in a strange world and must find their way home. While the TV series can stand alone without the site, its inclusion is designed to greatly enhance engagement. Game Progression The overall game consists of six worlds which will unlock at key stages during the broadcast schedule. The player will take on the persona of a fifth boy who is lost between dimensions. Cast into an unknown world and pursued by a mysterious force known only as 'The Darkness', the player is drawn to a strange apparition who promises that she can get you home... if you help her to rebuild a powerful Talisman. Your involuntary quest becomes a bid for survival that tests the limits of your ability as you travel through the five elemental worlds; Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Spirit, before confronting 'The Darkness' in a climactic battle. As you advance on your journey you begin to see the Nowhere Boys and other series characters through tears that appear between the dimensions. Before long it becomes clear that you share a common enemy with the Nowhere Boys and that you will play an integral role in helping them get back home. TV-crossover We are very excited at the unique crossover we have created between the game and the TV series. These platforms have been carefully intertwined to give the player the feeling that they are directly influencing the TV show. The player will pass objects through dimensions and then see them actually appear in the TV series during the next transmission. These objects help the Nowhere Boys on their mission and are often key to their survival. As the game culminates you will piece together an additional narrative that tells the story of how the Nowhere Boys fate directly impacted on your own life, giving you a knowledge of the Nowhere Boys' universe that is far greater than that of any of the characters in the series. Ultimately, both platforms converge in a final dramatic twist and you will be key in a climactic event that has a major influence on the TV series - YOU made it happen!",2013,"Adventure, Horror, Mystery            ","Rahart Adams, Dougie Baldwin, Nicholas Colla, Darius Googe",,0,,0.0

Our view of the future: As a civilization we have learned to use technology to enhance our lives, not to constrain them. Technology is no longer a burden on our ecosystem since the day we stopped depending on fossil fuels. We have also reconciled our passion for survival as a species with that of coexistence with the planet and the people living in it, no matter how different. A day called ""Off Day"" was instituted (in the not too distant future) that celebrates our unity as a world and our humanity away from the technology we depend on. On ""Off Day"" all non-essential electrical power is turned off in celebration and remembrance of the day we became independent of fossil fuels. We take a day off of technology (except essentials like hospitals, refrigeration units, etc.) to explore the world we often forget exists outside our neighborhoods. We take the time to meet people, travel by foot and not by car, create, and make friends with strangers. We live in a world of others; this day is celebrated internationally to promote this quality of humanity across the world. In our film, we go about chronicling one young girl's letter to herself in the future.

Disappointment Valley: A Modern Day Western,105,"This is the story America's wild horses tell us about ourselves, globalization, and the ability of a storyteller to persevere, despite being targeted by the most powerful government in the world. In Disappointment Valley, filmmaker James Anaquad Kleinert discovers a unique, undisturbed band of wild horses, living free in Disappointment Valley, their natural habitat in Southwestern Colorado. Kleinert documents his relationship with the majestic herd, led by their iconic stallion, Traveler. This relationship is brutally interrupted by government helicopter roundups; Traveler is injured and separated from his family, the tribe of wild horses is devastated. The event is a turning point for Kleinert, who sets out to understand the reasons behind the brutal roundups by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that are pushing the herd to the edge of extinction. As he fights to get Traveler free, Kleinert discovers that the extraction industries have been ignoring and perverting the laws to protect the mustangs, jeopardizing the fate of both wild horses and public lands. The BLM is the agency that is supposedly protecting the wild horses, but the US government's second-largest source of income is the leasing of Public Lands to extractive industries. Oil and gas fracturing, uranium and other ""rare earth"" mining, is immanent in Disappointment Valley. Through interviews with the Department of the Interior, politicians, scientists, attorneys, miners, cowboys, Indians, and innocent people telling of their lives destroyed, Disappointment Valley shares a revealing look into the modern day American West. Kleinert is tagged as a potential eco-terrorist and put under surveillance by the government; he partners with one of the nation's leading FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) attorneys to investigate the surveillance. The fear created by the surveillance and the stress of being labeled a terrorist - no habeas corpus, just long-term prison sentences - forces Kleinert to flee to safety in Norway, where he experiences a receptiveness to his work he never experienced in the US - and finds love. He is called back from Norway to Washington D.C., where he brings his case - Kleinert vs. BLM - to federal court and wins a major victory. Federal Judge Bates strongly admonishes the BLM for its improper FOIA withholdings; it is clearly revealed that the BLM was working to thwart Kleinert's investigative documentary. Kleinert vs. BLM has set important precedent for future public records and legal proceedings with the BLM, helping citizens, western public land issues, and upholding the right of the public to full disclosure and Truth. After almost two years away from the wild horses, Kleinert returns to discover Disappointment Valley is on the verge of extensive extraction. Under the deregulation policies of the Trump administration, the BLM is managing herd dynamics with the controversial birth control drug, PZP, which has significant consequences on social behavior and reproductive cycles of wild horses. Kleinert doubles his efforts to educate the public on the plight of the wild horses, which so clearly mirror our own human quest for freedom. By protecting the rights of these majestic creatures, we are taking a giant leap forward in the protection of the wild spaces that support us, connect us, and that define the ""land of the free, and the home of the brave"".",2017,"Documentary, Adventure, Drama            ","Viggo Mortensen, Daryl Hannah, Sheryl Crow, Michael Blake",James Kleinert,0,,0.0

The propeller for putting so much time into this edit was the thought of simply interpreting the tour, although limited by the footage that I had from it, in an honest way as well as being able to show people how other people are.

God hates Finland,11,"A man travels deep in the snowy forests of Finland. He is late to a ferry as his rental car breaks down. Ill equipped to repair the car and heavy snowfall forces him to contact the locals, a task that seems to fill him with fear because he doesn't speak the language. He's not just a fish out of the water, he's a white shark thrown into a snowy forest. And like all cornered sharks he lets his fears and vivd imagination run amok. This is a black comedy that tries to find out why God hates Finland. Because he does. Finland's constant source of conflict is the two official languages. The Finns are - by default - very bad at communicating so giving them two languages certainly doesn't help. Also, most Finns are unable to solve conflicts with a normal discussion. They rather avoid conflict and instead clench their fists in their pockets up until they erupt because of something trivial. Putting a Finnish speaker on the Swedish island of Åland is a nice conflict. A man with an overgrown inferiority complex meets a nepotistic island where the motto seems to be 'if you can't make it here, you can't make it anywhere'. On a more serious note: God hates Finland takes a growing problem of today, our fear of the unknown and racism, and displays it in all its naked stupidity.....and lets and unexpected underog, Finland's third language, win. This short was made on a extremly tight budget by a team who believed in the story and we would love to share it with the rest of the world.",2017,"Short, Action, Adventure            ","Sonja Ahlfors, Cris af Enehielm, Johan Karrento, Maya Kovacic",Johan Karrento,0,,0.0

The Maestro of Mongolia,25,"My name is Jerry Aylmer and one fine day I found myself in Tajikistan, in possession of a totally unsuitable car. I had quit my trading job in London in order to try and make a difference rather than a profit. Having driven an ambulance from the UK to donate to a hospital in Tajikistan, I now had a new mission; to deliver a small car to a charity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. My plan was to drive north east through Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Russia's Altai Republic. I would then cross Mongolia all the way to Ulaanbaatar, in winter, covering 10,000km of bad or non-existent roads. It would involve driving at nearly 5000m altitude through the spectacular and remote Pamir Mountains and then across the barren unmapped high plains of Mongolia with temperatures dropping to -20 degrees centigrade. An exceedingly sturdy 4x4 vehicle would normally be the minimum requirement. For company I instead had Marvin, a Rover Maestro. This is a car rarely mentioned in dispatches concerning Britain's great engineering achievements. And besides this one was built in Bulgaria. Marvin was small, had a rather world-weary look about him, and dodgy brakes. This is a story of exploration and adventure through some of the most remote lands and cultures on the planet, from nomadic shepherds in the mountains of Tajikistan to Kazakh eagle hunters in the Mongolian wilderness. It is a story of fascinating people, yurts, blizzards and being held up at gunpoint; a journey of self discovery while getting lost in the vast Mongolian wilderness.",2014,"Documentary, Adventure, Drama            ",Jerry Aylmer,,0,,0.0

High atop these remote ridgelines above the Great Basin, a region of unforgiving deserts, mountain ranges and sagebrush steppes, is the frontline of raptor conservation. Our journey began and ended with the whisk of broad wings. The golden eagle took flight and floated skyward. We had joined the migration and followed golden eagles for thousands of miles-a fraction of their entire route-and just long enough to peek into their remarkable journey. We got to know and admire the biologists and passionate volunteers who briefly intercept a handful of them along the way, gathering information that will help generations of raptors to come. We drove, hiked, fished, and camped in the unforgiving landscapes that these wayward fliers have relied on for millennia. And perhaps most importantly, we experienced what stewardship and conservation can accomplish. Fifty years ago, golden eagles and their raptor allies hung on the edge of extinction. A collective decision was made to ensure that raptors must continue to flood autumn skies. And while the efforts of a few dozen biologists may seem insignificant, it's the cumulative effort over decades that counts, and it shapes the future of our planet's wild places and creatures.",2017,"Documentary, Short, Adventure            ","Charles Post, Max Lowe, Charles Post, Forest Woodward",,5,,7.6

The Lax Kw'alaams are the keepers of Lelu Island and its connected Flora Bank, a massive sand bar that is part of the Skeena River estuary and known by fisheries biologists as some of the most important salmon habitat in Canada. The project would devastate the Skeena River, the natural wildlife and countless communities in the path of the LNG pipeline that will feed the terminal with fracked gas from Northeastern B.C. The Lax Kw'alaams have voted unanimously against the project and became legendary when they rejected a $1.15 billion dollar deal from Petronas in an attempt by the company to gain consent. Ignoring the voice of the Lax Kw'alaams, Petronas, with full backing of the Provincial Government have illegally begun drilling into Flora Bank where they now face off against warriors of the Lax Kw'alaams who have occupied the island since August 2015.

The film was shot on location in Tibet and in northern India. Tibetan nomads are being forcibly relocated by Chinese officials-shifted off their traditional grazing lands into concrete ghettos, where they are marginalized and have little chance of making a decent living, or finding a new profession. Previously, when grazing yaks, they were self-sufficient and lived in an entirely sustainable way. Now, they are unemployed, and dependent on the Chinese government for hand-outs-and for food. In an era where sustainability is the mantra, Chinese policy makes no sense. This re-settlement policy is designed to wipe out nomad culture and its strong connections to traditional Tibetan values. Nomads are the stewards of the vast grasslands of Tibet-they have been grazing these lands with their yaks for close on 4000 years. Without the nomads, the grasslands (already affected by climate change) will further deteriorate and turn into desert.",2011,"Documentary, Short, Adventure            ",Michael Buckley,,0,,0.0

RMS Titanic: The Story Biograph Told,60,"The harrowing story of a young newly married couple on their return honeymoon voyage. However, the groom is the son of the founder of Biograph Company, Henry Marvin. The 1912 news reads as follows... Miss Mary G. C. Farquharsen, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Farquharsen of 317 Riverside Drive, was married to Daniel Warren Marvin on Tuesday. The ceremony was performed in the home of the bride's parents by the Rev. Dr. John Caughey of the Harlem Presbyterian Church. The bridegroom was a son of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Norton Marvin, who was a founder of the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company. Mr. and Mrs. Marvin sailed on the Mauretania on Wednesday for a bridal trip of five weeks. Daniel and Mary boarded the Titanic at Southampton as first class passengers. They were returning to New York City from their honeymoon in Europe. They occupied cabin D-30. The RMS Titanic was the second of a trio of super-liners intended to dominate the transatlantic travel business. Owned by the White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland, Titanic was the largest passenger steamship in the world at the time of its launching. On the return voyage. it struck an iceberg at 11:40 PM (ship's time). On the night of the accident Daniel assisted his wife to a lifeboat with the words ""It's alright, little girl. You go. I will stay."". The RMS Titanic sank at 2:20 AM Monday morning on April 15, 1912. Among the crowds that gathered at the New York offices of White Star on April 15 1912 were relatives of both Daniel and Mary Marvin: Mrs Frank Farquarson and Mrs W.H. Marvin learned that Mary had been saved but there was no word of Daniel Marvin. When returning from picking up the RMS Titanic survivors, the rescue ship Carpathia docked, and Mrs. Daniel Marvin fainted when she learned that there was no hope for her husband to be alive. - ""He kissed me goodbye,"" stated the poor young lady, ""and I never saw him again."" Daniel died in the sinking, his body, if recovered, was never identified. Over 90 years later, Biograph has recovered and acquired the actual film images taken aboard the Titanic, believed to have been taken by Marvin.

Ten Thousand Miles,69,"Gesang Duojie, a shy 19-year-old Tibetan, has never left his farming village. Abruptly, at his mother's behest, he climbs onto the back of a small motorbike to see the world, May 4, 2009, traveling 8,000km with two men in their early 20s he doesn't know, one from Eastern China, the other from Switzerland, and their friend, a Brazilian cinematographer. Authorities, monks, students and gangsters will join near-death experiences to challenge the foursome's will and outlook on life in Ten Thousand Miles. They bump and wheel, initially a biker's road dream until disasters strike, across vast stretches of icy, snowy spring Himalayas from the religious center of Tibet, Lhasa, through earthquake-ravaged Sichuan to the lightning-rich deserts of Inner Mongolia, dazed at the end by the beat of China's commercial heart, Shanghai, dense with skyscrapers. Ten Thousand Miles is more than just a high-adventure road trip, though: it offers a very rare opportunity to hear the voices of China's coming-of-age adults. The adventurers continually interview young people in remote villages, then bustling urban centers, asking them about their hopes for the future and their dreams, their views of the world. Farmers, gangsters, nomads, musicians and wealthy business people form a vivid tapestry but also give voice to a society that is a key player in 21st century Asia. Woven throughout the story is the rich thread of how the travelers are reshaped by both the dramas and the ordinary people they meet.",2010,"Documentary, Adventure            ","Liam Bates, Patrick Caracas, Gesang Duojie, Wen Xiang Ying","Liam Bates, Patrick Caracas",0,,0.0
