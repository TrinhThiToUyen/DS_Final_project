In an excruciating ritual, Nhagrulls skin was flayed into pages, his bones hammered into a cover, and his diseased blood became the ink to pen a book most vile. All those exposed to the book were driven to madness or so corrupted by the wicked knowledge contained within that they had no choice but to turn evil. Misery and bloodshed followed the disciples of Nhagruul as they spread their Masters dark dream. Creatures vile and depraved rose from every pit and unclean barrow to partake in the fever of destruction. The cities and kingdoms of Karkoth were consumed by this plague of evil until an order of warriors arose from the ashes. The Knights of the New Sun swore an oath to resurrect hope in the land. The purity of their hearts was so great that Pelor, the God of Light, gave the Knights powerful amulets with which to channel his power.

The disciples of Nhagruul disassembled the book and bribed three greedy souls to hide the pieces until they could be retrieved. The ink was discovered and destroyed but, despite years of searching, the cover and pages were never found. Peace ruled the land for centuries and the Knights got lost in the light of their own glory. As memory of the awful events faded so did the power of servants of Pelor.

The story is a love quadrangle between an uncompromising idealist rebel, a merciless Turkish officer, an opportunist rich man's son returning home after his studies in Europe and a lucid and open minded European woman, who flirts with the three men and puts in train a series of events with dire consequences, that she could hardly imagine. The characters go through turbulent collisions which lead them to cathartic experiences and new self-awareness. The film is a harsh and romantic story in which the eternal Macedonian cause for own identity and independence is seen through the prism of relativity of the ideas of freedom, justice, love, sacrifice, and treason. The story dramatizes and parodies the myth and anti-myth of East and West, of Europe and the Balkans. It leads to a boiling point the paradoxes and absurdities of Macedonian history.",2014,"Action, Drama, History            ","Inti Sraj, Sasko Kocev, Martin Jordanoski, Toni Mihajlovski",Stole Popov,547,,7.5

She secretly attempts to build political bridges to the Calinar without the knowledge of the power-hungry Alliance Fleet Command or Arina's Commander ranked Fiancée TERRY LINDON (late 30s). However, Arina is deeply torn, because, although she desires peace, she is constantly thrust into battles that force her to destroy the Calinar. Moreover, a devout believer in one of the Alliance sanctioned religious beliefs; the Deridian sect, she discovers the disgusting truth about the galactic control that has been quietly placed in the hearts and minds of not only the Alliance population, but also the Calinar. Intrigue rises to greater intrigue as she and her close band of crack pilots discover that the Alliance and the Calinar are actually allies in a horrifyingly perfect plan to enslave both races under the iron thumb of totalitarian governmental power. She and her friends must form a para-Alliance resistance that threatens to tear apart the very values that established the unification of the human race. Chased across the galaxy as outlaws, Arina gathers a larger following from both human and Calinar freedom fighters. When her only option is to create civil unrest, the cataclysmic war machine of both races plot to erase the existence and memory of Arina and her followers. On the brink of her destruction, however, Arina discovers that the answer to war and genocide is found in your enemy. Once Arina's startling discovery is brought to Alliance Command, the civil war changes players and pits the military against the seedy and underestimated religious sects. The Alliance and Calinar cast and characters find themselves constantly positioning themselves to stay alive, fight for their race and keep their principles from being shredded upon the blade of honor.",2017,"Action, Sci-Fi            ","Richard Hatch, Tim Russ, James Kyson, Aron Eisenberg",,23,,8.4

Growing up in foster care, all she has in the world is her brother TOMAS. When she learns that her brother was murdered by the gang he ran with, LOS MUERTOS, Jaylene resolves to find his murderer, and discovers it was the leader of the gang, MR. CLEAN. Jaylene tracks down Mr. Clean, and his personal death squad, THE MALAS, at a local bar. She infiltrates the Malas when the bar is attacked by the gang's fiercest rival, and Jaylene saves one of them from certain death. Thus our heroine is inducted into the Malas, whose sole mission is murder. They have the highest respect of any of the female Los Muertos: they only sleep with men they want to sleep with, they get a cut of the money, and have power within the leadership. They listen to Reggaeton together, dance together, laugh together, do drugs together, and kill together. They had each other's backs when their families discarded them. But pledging allegiance to the gang has a cost, and the Malas have their enemies: police, rival gangs, and even members of Los Muertos. The deeper Jaylene goes, the more danger she's in. Yet, she finds herself surrounded by the familial acceptance she's desperately craved her entire life. When our heroine finally gets the chance to murder the man who killed her brother, she realizes she must choose between her past and her new future with the Malas.

As she learns more about him, she realizes he's involved in a secret scientific project led by a Secret Intelligence Service Agent Agent Case (Otty Warmann) where Jack is attempting to develop technology that creates wormholes based on his grandfather's previous work in physics. As the story progresses and Jas is recruited into the program, they both test the technology and end up in a deserted parallel reality to the one they were in. Upon returning to the original time line, Jack is trapped and remains in the parallel universe and must use his time and resources to repair his wormhole device to allow him to recreate a wormhole and travel back to the original time line. Simultaneously, the gravity strength of his reality is greater than that of Jas's reality, resulting in his biological clock ticking slower than hers. At this point Jas grows up faster than Jack does in his parallel reality. During the test runs, Jack makes contact with Older Jas (Iona Felfeli) when she is a dance teacher during one of her lessons with students. She has a subtle sense of Jack's presence and realises he is still alive. This prompts her memory to find Jack's note that she kept hidden for so long, instructing her to use the second wormhole. Jack then makes a final attempt at creating a wormhole. He successfully creates one with Older Jas's help. Together they return to the original time line after co-creating an Einstein-Rosen bridge (wormhole) together. Later on, Jack finds himself resting in a clinical setting and speaks with Agent Case about leaving the program and moving on with his life. Agent Case brings Jas in to talk with him. Jack realizes he wants to go back in time to see his parents, implying a butterfly effect, whereby him and her would never have met and the technology would no longer exist. Despite building her own family life, she relictantly decides to help him escape from Agent Case who attempts to stop his getaway, but he is too late as Jack escapes for the final time.",2017,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi            ","Luana Alta, Iona Felfeli, Liam O'Hagan Mallon, Otty Warmann",Ranw Aso-Rashid,0,,0.0

As Eddie searches he meets and is befriended by Layla, a gorgeous nursing-student in the midst of a break-up with, Clarence Makaha, perhaps the most dangerous local on the North Shore, and known through out the region for his skills in mixed-martial arts.

Befriend and Betray,85,"Criminal organizations succeed by enforcing a strict code of trust and loyalty. To penetrate these organizations and gain access to their inner circles the police need a magic bullet. Alex Caine is that magic bullet. Only thirty years old, Alex, who grew up hard on the mean streets of Montreal, already brings a lifetime's worth of experience (foster care, military service, prison time) to the world's most dangerous occupation: professional gang infiltrator. It is his job to befriend criminals, participate in their illegal activities, gather evidence - then live long enough to testify against them in court. Inspired by real-life events, Befriend and Betray tells the story of Alex's first infiltration assignment - the case that transformed him from a rootless young man into a highly effective, defiantly unconventional crime-fighting resource. Approached by P.C. Lau, a ruthlessly ambitious soldier for the Kam Tin Triad, Alex is asked to help his old prison acquaintance with a business proposition. Since Alex comes from Montreal and speaks French, P.C. figures he's just the man to be the face of the Kam Tin as they try to move their heroin into eastern Canada. What P.C. doesn't realize is that Alex has been approached by the police and Criminal Intelligence Services who've asked him to say ""yes"" to P.C.'s proposal - thus giving them a long sought-after way into the Kam Tin. Complicating matters for Alex is the fact that his girlfriend Melanie has no idea that he's agreed to work for the police. Alex figures that the less she knows, the safer she'll be. Trouble is, the more he lies to protect her, the more likely he is to lose the one person who sees him as more than just a valuable crime-fighting asset. Combining action, suspense, humour and actual details drawn from the case files of Alex Caine, Befriend and Betray tells the story of one man's re-birth as an infiltrator - and his struggle not to lose his identity or his life along the way.",2011,"Action, Crime, Drama            ","Tim Rozon, Byron Mann, Tom Jackson, Steph Song",Ken Girotti,105,,5.0

Everything comes to a breaking point when Zach's team threatens to remove him from the group and the deceptive truth behind Bentton's project comes to light.

Candide,100,"We believe that adapting Voltaire's Candide (originally published in 1759) in a free way entirely based on contemporary references, is a revolutionary mission. Not only because it is a rare take on animation as a genre, but also because - in a much entertaining way - it is a critical interpretation of the challenges imposed on core democratic values. This is a series that isn't just a visual gag or a wonderfully cheap laugh, but it also looks some very hard realities of life straight in the eye. We are convinced that there is a need among the audience to watch culturally rich, thoughtful unique animation shows, which reflect on our current situation in a satirical tone. Imagine Candide as the new show completely aware of The Amazing World of Gumball, as well as South Park, Rick and Morty or Bojack Horseman, yet with a distinguished graphic design, and characters partly 18th century partly 21st century style. Candide is a non-conventional show, it works with witty, critical thinking yet it quotes popular topics from mass media, like cutting out Rainforests, climate change and the political-financial elite, the effects of terrorism, life in warzones, unresolved immigration issues, emerging dictatorship, challenges of the high tech lifestyles, or man in space. It is made in the spirit of Voltaire, but it takes place in today's globalized world, therefore there are many ways to see ourselves in this mirror .",2018,"Animation, Action, Adventure            ",,,18,,8.0

He is then beaten up by some young hoodlums who mock his quest. Bed-ridden, Dennis' landlord-cum-doctor discovers the cause of his insanity: the sic-fi DVDs that he consistently watches. He throws them out - but not before Dennis has escaped from his room and left with his new friend, the nincompoop Hadrian Gutt. Dennis and Hadrian find a speeder called Boris and then set out to fight a rancor - which a Sith Lord turns into a statue at the last minute. They encounter some ewoks, solve the romantic problems of a wookiee and also find Master Yoda's light sabre in the dankest depths of London's Soho. Obi Wan also liberates a Princess, before entering into single combat with a Sith Lord, Moff Tarkin, and freeing Marina Ambramovic from her 512-hour imprisonment.

What is unclear, is whether or not Mace has actually lived multiple lifetimes, or if he's just an old soul stuck in a modern world. In any case, his massive accumulation of knowledge, skills and experience certainly make it seem as if he's had more than a single lifetime of learning, while his penchant for 1940s style seems to hint at his unwillingness to keep up with the times. It's often difficult to know whether he's stuck in time, or if he simply got tired of trying to keep up with the changes around him. Alternating between an incredibly modern savvy for all things technical and a seemingly outdated social view... Mace can be at times both awe inspiring and exasperating... especially if you're a woman. What is never in doubt however, is his uncanny ability to solve the most baffling criminal mysteries.

A spear -- the difference between a family living or dying... But the axe and the spear could also become weapons, as individuals, tribes, and eventually nations struggled against each other in their fierce determination to survive. Since the invention of firearms in China more than 900 years ago, the GUN, has been both a tool to conquer game and a weapon for killing men. GUNS gave individual men great power, and gave groups of men the power to both enforce and resist the will of rulers. The United States of America is a nation born well after the invention of firearms -- a nation whose size and influence expanded alongside the development, and with the use and growth, of personal firearms. What were the GUNS that conquered the land that would become the United States, and how did they develop? How did firearms change the course of this continent's future, and how were advancements in firearm technology used by men and even other nations throughout the American experience? Since 1775 and the ""Shot Heard Round the World,"" American patriots would put muskets to shoulder, and fight for liberty -- a liberty that would be forged in battle, achieved and defended by the AMERICAN GUN.

Tokyo Joshi Pro,0,"On June 4, 2012, Tokyo Joshi Pro was announced by DDT Pro Wrestling. Set to be run by former Ice Ribbon and NEO Japan Ladies Pro-Wrestling promoter and booker Tetsuya Kodo and wrestler Nozomi, the promotion was established in late 2012 and thus a recruitment process began for wrestlers. 4 of the first wrestlers recruited were Miyu Yamashita, Shoko Nakajima, Kanna and Chikage Kiba. The training of the wrestlers was mostly handled by Nozomi herself, with help from DDT wrestler Kyohei Mikami. Nozomi left DDT on November 30, 2012, but on the same day the trainees were introduced to the public in a press conference and it was announced they would debut in 2013. The trainees were required to follow three rules - no drinking, no smoking, and no boyfriends. Early years (2013-2015) Tokyo Joshi Pro Wrestling's debut show took place on January 30, 2013 at Akihabara Twin Box in Tokyo. The show featured just two matches, a sambo exhibition between trainee Chikage Kiba and DDT referee and former sambo competitor Daisuke Kiso, and a singles match between trainees Miyu Yamashita and Kanna. The show did not use a wrestling ring, and instead all matches took place on training mats, similar to the Ice Ribbon promotion in its early years. Along with wrestling matches, the debut show featured live music from idol units. As TJP's roster was very small at the start, most of their early shows followed this same formula and only ran small venues. Entry to their first few shows was free as a way of introducing themselves to a bigger audience, and their first paid show was held on April 26. As their roster of trainees expanded in 2014, TJP began including more matches on their cards, and began using a ring. They also ran a show with an appearance from voice actress/wrestler Ai Shimizu in November 2014. TJP held its first full show without an idol performance on February 28, 2015 at Shinjuku Face. At the show, Ai Shimizu and Saki Akai confirmed they would be competing with the promotion regularly, and more trainees debuted at the show. Rise in popularity (2016-present) On January 4, 2016, TJP held its first ever show in Korakuen Hall, a famed wrestling venue in puroresu. Main evented by Miyu Yamashita defeating Shoko Nakajima to become the first ever Tokyo Princess of Princess Champion, it also featured the debut of Yuu and an appearance from American wrestler Candice LeRae. In the spring of 2016, Ai Shimizu and Erin announced their departure from the promotion, however, the summer was a success for the promotion, and TJP earned a broadcasting deal to be shown on idol-centric channel Pigoo. On January 4, 2017, TJP held its second annual Korakuen show, main evented by Yuu retaining the Tokyo Princess of Princess title over Shoko Nakajima. On May 29, an audition was held for four young wrestlers to form a wrestling/idol group to be known as the ""Up-Up Girls"". On July 20, four women were picked and began training to wrestle shortly after. On December 4, the Up-Up Girls debuted with an idol performance, but didn't appear in ring until January 4, 2018. On January 4, 2018, TJP's third annual Korakuen show proved to be a success, drawing over 1000 fans for the first time ever. The show was also broadcast on AbemaTV for the first time, as well as DDT's streaming service. The show was main evented by TJP ace Miyu Yamashita defeating Reika Saiki to win back the Tokyo Princess of Princess Championship. On February 28, the TJP show from Shinjuku Face was once again broadcast on AbemaTV, and it was announced Abema had picked up TJP to broadcast it regularly. This also marked the end of TJP being broadcast on Pigoo. On November 1, 2018, the three trainee rules were officially bought to an end, allowing wrestlers to drink, smoke and have relationships on their own accord. The 2019 January 4 show was once again a success, drawing 1300 fans to Korakuen Hall. On July 16, 2019, TJP announced, via their Twitter account, a new title called the International Princess Championship. They also announced that the Tokyo Princess of Princess Championship and the Tokyo Princess Tag Team Championship would be dropping ""Tokyo"" from their names.",2014,"Action, Drama, Sport            ","Miyu Yamashita, Yuka Sakazaki, Nonoko, Shoko Nakajima",,0,,0.0

Vitamin Z,0,"Apocalypse. Every culture has a story describing the end of the world. Some see it as a time of judgment, others as a time of cleansing, and others still see it as just an end. But no one could have predicted how it would really happen. Two years ago the People's Republic of China and its allies formulated a ""Super Soldier Serum"" intended to modify the genetic makeup of their soldiers. However, the compound was compromised before the final stage of testing was complete. This resulted in what is now considered the first occurrence of demortification. China considered this an opportunity. The Chinese government created a nutritional supplement dubbed Vitamin Z. Through a massive propaganda campaign, including millions of bottles of free samples and an endorsement from sports legend Destiny Greene, more than half the world was exposed to the product within a week. The people of the world were quickly taken with the magnificent abilities the drink provided. Increased strength, speed, perceptions, as well as an amazingly accelerated rate of healing soon earned it the title of ""Miracle Drink"". However the true miracle was later revealed as people started dying and then coming back to life as ferocious creatures bent on killing and then eating their victims. The world was plunged into chaos in just a few weeks as millions were killed and then turned into monsters. The virus came to be named after the drink that spawned it: Vitamin Z. What came after even China hadn't anticipated, as they too were consumed by the plague. The whole world was consumed. It has been two years since the apocalypse, and the only challenge greater than evading the undead, is finding food. Bands of survivors roam the world, but as supplies dwindle and their stomachs growl in hunger, they have to ask themselves, ""What would you do to survive?""",2013,"Action, Drama, Thriller            ","Douglas Farra, E'va Stepniewska, Zach Silver, Nailya Shakirova",,35,,5.9

Sometime we hurt ourselves due to the action of Kungfu, however, we thought it was worthy. Moreover, I made some props with production designer, such as the fake fire extinguisher. And I went to a few shopping malls looking for costume with the DOP. In whole production, we just spent approximate 24 hours in total within three nights shooting this film. It is too rush.

God hates Finland,11,"A man travels deep in the snowy forests of Finland. He is late to a ferry as his rental car breaks down. Ill equipped to repair the car and heavy snowfall forces him to contact the locals, a task that seems to fill him with fear because he doesn't speak the language. He's not just a fish out of the water, he's a white shark thrown into a snowy forest. And like all cornered sharks he lets his fears and vivd imagination run amok. This is a black comedy that tries to find out why God hates Finland. Because he does. Finland's constant source of conflict is the two official languages. The Finns are - by default - very bad at communicating so giving them two languages certainly doesn't help. Also, most Finns are unable to solve conflicts with a normal discussion. They rather avoid conflict and instead clench their fists in their pockets up until they erupt because of something trivial. Putting a Finnish speaker on the Swedish island of Åland is a nice conflict. A man with an overgrown inferiority complex meets a nepotistic island where the motto seems to be 'if you can't make it here, you can't make it anywhere'. On a more serious note: God hates Finland takes a growing problem of today, our fear of the unknown and racism, and displays it in all its naked stupidity.....and lets and unexpected underog, Finland's third language, win. This short was made on a extremly tight budget by a team who believed in the story and we would love to share it with the rest of the world.",2017,"Short, Action, Adventure            ","Sonja Ahlfors, Cris af Enehielm, Johan Karrento, Maya Kovacic",Johan Karrento,0,,0.0

Hell in a Cell,20,"The main feud heading into Hell in a Cell was between Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton over the vacant WWE Championship. After defeating John Cena to win the WWE title at SummerSlam in August, Bryan was betrayed by the special referee of that match, Triple H, which allowed Orton to cash-in his Money in the Bank contract and win the championship. In their rematch at Night of Champions in September, Bryan defeated Orton to win back the title, albeit with the referee Scott Armstrong deciding the pinfall with a very fast count. This controversial ending to the match resulted in Armstrong's (kayfabe) firing and Bryan being stripped of the WWE Championship by Triple H the next night on Raw. Bryan and Orton's next scheduled encounter for the now-vacant title on pay-per-view at Battleground on October 6 ended in a no contest after Big Show interfered and attacked both wrestlers and the referees, including a returning Scott Armstrong. With still no WWE Champion yet, on the October 7 edition of Raw, general manager Brad Maddox announced that Bryan and Orton would again compete against each other for the vacant WWE title in Hell in a Cell and with a special referee for the audience to choose from WWE Hall of Famers Booker T, Bob Backlund and Shawn Michaels; Michaels won the vote. Another major feud playing out in the WWE pitted CM Punk against Paul Heyman and his wrestler clients, whom he dubs ""Paul Heyman guys"". At the Money in the Bank pay-per-view in July, while still posing as his supporter, Heyman turned on Punk and cost him the Money in the Bank ladder match for a future WWE Championship match. This started a rivalry that soon brought Heyman's client, Brock Lesnar, into the fray, leading to a No Disqualification match between Lesnar and Punk at SummerSlam, which the former won with Heyman's help. At Night of Champions the next month, in a 2-on-1 handicap elimination no disqualification match, Punk eliminated Curtis Axel (another Heyman's client), before beating down Heyman himself. However, Ryback interfered in the match and put Punk through a table, allowing Heyman to pin him and win the match. As the newest ""Paul Heyman guy"", Ryback faced Punk at Battleground, but lost the match, when Punk pinned him after hitting a low blow behind the referee's back. This loss irked both Heyman and Ryback, and it was officially announced on WWE.com on October 9, that Punk will face off against Ryback in a rematch at Hell in a Cell. On the October 14 episode of Raw, Heyman attempted to convince Maddox to turn the encounter into a 2-on-1 handicap match, with Axel teaming with Ryback. Instead, Maddox set up a ""beat the clock"" contest in two matches featuring Punk and Ryback individually, with the wrestler to win his match in shorter time than the other to pick the stipulation for their match at Hell in a Cell. Though Ryback defeated R-Truth in a time of 5:44, Punk defeated Axel with 11 seconds to spare, thus ""beating the clock"". As result of this victory, Punk himself added Heyman to the match as Ryback's partner, additionally making it a Hell in a Cell match, at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view.",2013,Action            ,"Randy Orton, Bryan Danielson, Shawn Michaels, C.M.
