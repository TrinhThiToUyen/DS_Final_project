Tom and Grant,24,"From the deep comedy well of 'dumb guys who think they're smart' we bring you Tom and Grant. Small time crooks, poster children for the disenfranchised, they've been swept to the periphery of the American Dream and left to pick up it's crumbs. They push back against the system, refusing to be lumped in with the masses in the heartland, adopting the mantra 'Quit your day job'. They seek a better way. Problem is, they're idiots. All they've got is a car, a dream, and a very dumb idea: let someone else rob the bank, and then rob the robbers. Theirs is a quest to plunge headlong into the Pantheon of Poor Choices. 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself'. Some Presidents offer quotes for the ages; others, not so much. These lowered standards have become the lyrics of a troubled era. It's the soundtrack of the misguided, and the music of choice of Tom and Grant. Just as Bruce Springsteen's lyrics for 'Born in the USA' were never anthemic, Tom and Grant's, 'When You Are a Star', was never intended to inspire... Tom Cavanagh and Grant Gustin, arch rivals on the television show 'The Flash', team up to play the titular small time crooks. Their brotherhood is the fuel that drives this caper, offering dissections of the movie stakeout archetype, musings on freedom, and a truly unfortunate misinterpretation of the term 'jazz hands'. Written and directed by Cavanagh, he marries the current politic of hearing only what we want to hear with the easy camaraderie of the buddy pic.",2018,"Short, Comedy            ","Tom Cavanagh, Grant Gustin, Everick Golding, Dylan Playfair",Tom Cavanagh,164,,8.5

Call Me Lucky,106,"Barry Crimmins is pissed. His hellfire brand of comedy has rained verbal lightning bolts on American audiences and politicians for decades, yet you've probably never heard of him. But once you've experienced Bobcat Goldthwait's brilliant character portrait of him and heard Crimmins's secret, you will never forget him. From his unmistakable bullish frame came a scathingly ribald stand-up style that took early audiences by force. Through stark, smart observation and judo-like turns of phrase, Crimmins's rapid-fire comedy was a war on ignorance and complacency in '80s America at the height of an ill-considered foreign policy. Crimmins discusses another side of his character, revealing in detail a dark and painful past that inspired his life-changing campaign of activism in the hope of saving others from a similar experience. Interviews with comics like Margaret Cho and Marc Maron illustrate Crimmins's love affair with comedy and his role in discovering and supporting the development of many of today's stars. As a venerated member of America's comic community, Crimmins could be your newest national treasure.

All Stars,98,"""ALL-STARS"" follows a girls' 10-year-old fastpitch softball team and their families through a recreation league season that culminates in the selection of the coveted 10-and-under All-Star team. Lance Grayden, a veteran coach who left the league years ago when his daughter moved to an elite softball club team, and then college, has returned to ""give something back"" to the community. He assumed he'd be coaching a 16-and-under team of seasoned and accomplished competitors, but instead is saddled with a 10-and-under team of inexperienced players. Not only is he forced to go back to the basics and teach the fundamentals of the game to the little girls, half of whom would rather be in the dugout eating snacks, but he also faces the greater challenge of riding herd over their over-eager, overly ambitious, and entirely delusional parents whose ridiculous behavior is more suited to five-year-olds than adults. Lance also faces a personal decision about whether it's more important to win at all costs or to teach the girls something their parents seem to have forgotten: that each player is a valuable member of the team and fair play is more important than winning. Even though he knows what the answer should be, Lance's moral compass is severely tested by the relentless take-no-prisoners mentality of the parents as well as his own ambitions and innate drive to win. He may be dealing with eight, nine, and ten-year-old little girls, but he is, after all, only human. Meanwhile, each parent is on a mission to ensure that their nine-year-old prodigy is recognized as the elite athlete they imagine her to be, whether or not she possesses one whit of actual athletic ability. The parents' blind ambitions, combined with their grand delusions, give each parent the baseless notion that the Holy Grail - an All-Star jacket with their child's name on the back - is not only within reach, but is her God-given-birthright. ""All-Stars"" provides a hilarious commentary on the state of all youth sports today, fueled by the outrageous behavior of the desperate sports parent living vicariously through his or her child. In the vein of a Christopher Guest film - think ""Best in Show"" where it's more about the dog owners than the dogs - ""All-Stars"" is about the adults involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires, volunteers, board members, etc.) more than the kids.",2014,Comedy            ,"Fred Willard, Miriam Flynn, Logan Kinsey, Mike Hagerty",Lance Kinsey,274,,6.5

Dimitri delivers Pizzas for a living - but as a young black man he is faced with ""extra"" challenges while navigating the city. The film explores the reasons why so many black men have concerns of unfair treatment, especially while driving. We get to see the psychology behind Dimitri's attitude towards the police, through piercing flashbacks to his prior experiences with the cops - from childhood to present day, the cops have always had their eye on him. The script was written with technical advice from the Sheriffs Department in order to create something totally authentic, showing the real deal about police attitudes towards DRIVING WHILE BLACK and ""race out of place"". The film will be shot with the realism of a documentary. The use of original artwork, Instagram and other digital graphics will give the film a modern, and unique feel. We will follow Dimitri on his path to his dream job as a Hollywood tour guide - and the many trials and tribulations he has to overcome just to get to the interview. It's an engaging and often emotional journey as sometimes things just aren't fair. But at its heart it is a comedy full of fun twists and turns. Anyone who has ever driven while black, (or knows someone who has) will laugh throughout - and it might just change an opinion or two",2015,"Comedy, Drama            ","Dominique Purdy, Sheila Tejada, John Mead, Joseph Ansalvish",Paul Sapiano,1404,$0.21M,7.8

Shooting for Socrates,91,"In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pel√© and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - ""a fee for this and a fee for that"") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) S√≥crates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - ""the next George Best"". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the ""top of the World"" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all. Set against the backdrop of the 1986 World Cup and the sociopolitical backgrounds of both nations - this is the story of the world's smallest footballing nation, taking on its best. With laughter and passion, this is the ultimate story of the beautiful game and what it means.",2014,"Comedy, Drama, Sport            ","John Hannah, Conleth Hill, Richard Dormer, Art Parkinson",James Erskine,211,,5.9

Two Down,92,"Two Down is the first theatrical feature from Fizz and Ginger Films, whom Screen International (UK), picked for their 'Stars of Tomorrow' edition in 2013. Set in modern day London, Two Down is nevertheless inspired by films of the 1970's, which gives this clever little thriller an interesting spin in the look, the dialogue and the sound. After surviving an explosion in Iraq, Mr. Thomas leaves the infuriating desk job the army had created for him and enters the underground world of the contract killer. His brother, Sam, had been caught selling on army secrets to the highest bidder and is now working for the illusive Harry Montagu. They use Mr. Thomas as a very effective way of eliminating problems they encounter in their business. That is until Mr. Thomas begins to question whom these problems are that he is removing, and why they deserve this fate. We start the film with Mr. Thomas following a target, a young woman. All is not as it seems as she manages to fight him off long enough for someone in the shadows to shoot him in the back. Thinking him dead they walk away, leaving him to die in the alleyway. Mr. Thomas, surviving, but injured, manages to get to a safe house owned by a friend. When he arrives however his friend is no longer there but a young woman, Sophie. Through necessity he takes her, and the local take-away delivery boy, hostage and waits for his partner to pick him up. Hours later he is still waiting and over the course of the evening, with the help of a bottle of whiskey and a Chinese take-away, they slowly unravel the events of the evening to discover that Mr. Thomas was set up. Led by a very keen Sophie they try to work out by who and why. But why is Sophie so eager to get to the bottom of the events of the evening? There is more than one mystery that Mr. Thomas has to solve, and he's quickly running out of time. The film features Conleth Hill (Game of Thrones, Suits), Felicity Montagu (Alan Partridge), Amy Manson (Once Upon A Time), Alex Hassell (Anonymous, RSC), Tori Hart (Keeping Rosy), Graham Butler ( Penny Dreadful), and host of great British actors.

But when Max, now pushing 40, begins to grow lazy and indifferent in the performing of even these minor tasks, he is unceremoniously fired and cast adrift - quickly discovering that society has little demand for an aging ex-professional buddy. Too old to compete with the up-and-comers and totally lacking any tangible ""real world"" skills, Max teeters on the verge of total breakdown. Ultimately though, Max will find new life through the eyes of the cute and quirky Bailey (Caplan), an elementary school teacher whose compassion helps Max discover that there is a place for him in the real world after all.

Bianca already has two suitors - Hortensio and Gremio - when a third, Lucentio, arrives on the scene. Baptista, however, has decreed that no one can marry Bianca until a husband has been found for Katherina. A solution presents itself when Hortensio's friend Petruchio arrives in town looking for a wife. After meeting Katherina, Petruchio is unperturbed by her insults and resolves to marry her, leaving the way clear for Hortensio (posing as a music teacher), Lucentio (posing as a literary tutor) and the hapless Gremio to continue their pursuit of Bianca, whom Baptista decides to bestow on the wealthiest of the three. An absurdly costumed Petruchio arrives late for his wedding and conducts himself outrageously throughout. Afterwards, instead of staying for the wedding banquet, he immediately carries the still-protesting Katherina off to his house in Verona. There he subjects her to a series of humiliations - having food prepared and then sending it away untouched, ordering fine clothes for her and then rejecting them in apparent rage - in a calculated strategy to break down her willful disposition.

"Gangsters, Guns & Zombies",88,"The whole ""zombie thing"" has been hyped up so much that everyone thinks it's the end of the world! Of course, where one man sees the dead rising from the grave, another sees opportunity. Q had a plan: drive the robbery getaway van, deliver everyone to the safe house and get paid - a nice, simple, plan. Unfortunately, life is never really that simple, and to top it all off, this is the first time Q has been a getaway driver. He's coping pretty well though, considering; TONY (the guy who is 'in charge' of the job) is a murderous nut case, DANNY was shot and is now bleeding all over the money in the back of the van, the Sat-Nav has a mind of its own, there's a guy in the back living up to his name ""CRAZY STEVE"", the safe-house already has police at it, and this whole ""zombie thing"" seems to be quickly becoming more of a ""zombie apocalypse thing"". Luckily, TONY knows of another Safe House on the coast. Not so luckily, DANNY dies of natural-ish causes and then rises from the grave. Q and the others have to deal with a recently zombie-fied medieval re-enactment group, a football team that seem hell bent on eating their brains and the van running out of fuel. In their search for refuge and some diesel, TONY spots - of all things - a fortified windmill and the group awkwardly team up with a lovely young woman called CASSIE and her insane, but well armed GRANDMA. As TONY descends into deeper and deeper psychosis, he forces a last stand against a zombie horde, dies horribly and takes GRANDMA with him. Not bad for a night's work. Some men are born into shit-storms, some achieve shit-storms, and some have shit-storms thrust upon them. Q is up to his neck in this one and must now take charge of the group in order to save his own skin - not to mention the much more attractive skin of CASSIE. Finally reaching the coast, the new group must figure out a way off this crazy island - lack of sailing know-how and the walking dead notwithstanding. Just when things couldn't get any worse, one of them suffers an accident and lands Q with a dilemma. In the one hand he holds his own life and in the other the lives of the group.

She's Got a Plan,94,"If you gave yourself only thirty days to make your dream come true before throwing in the towel, just how would you order your steps? That's the premise of She's Got and Plan and the 30 day journey of Isis Angelo, a female writer-director trying to 'make it' in Hollywood. When we meet Isis she is a down-on-her-luck director whose struggles with life, love and career have come to a head. The story opens with a frustrated Isis who is approaching middle age knows that her window of opportunity for Hollywood success is rapidly closing. She works regularly on random productions, making enough to pay the rent, buy lean cuisines, and keep her classic Mercedes with just enough gas in it to make it to the next pitch meeting. She's tired of the rat race, the hustle, and all of the empty shallow people that populate power positions in the industry. She is tired of looking for real love with men who don't understand her and fed up with LA traffic stuck in her car feeling sidelined by life. Isis longs for the success that attracted her to the industry but realizes she is clearly at the end of her rope. Faced with the question - When do you give up on your dreams? Isis is forced to 'make something happen' and she takes all the money she has - including the rent money - and gives herself, her life, and her career 30 days to ""make it"" in Hollywood. The ensuing stress, drama, and hilarity derived from this self imposed deadline, develops as we follow Isis's days on the calendar, and her confessional video diary that she creates to document her final struggle. We are taken from counseling sessions with her truly ghetto friend to hilarious two bit reality shows, seedy production houses, horny execs, and the ever alluring Hollywood night life to a relationship with a ""dream Kodak"" boyfriend who of course is a dud. This comedic action enhanced by appearances of many recognizable members of black Hollywood is inter cut with serious, emotional scenes of Isis reflecting on her daily life, dealing with the worries and aspirations of her mother, and attempting to remain a real human being in a business increasingly filled with fake characters. Isis gets her big break when her heartfelt break up with her ""Kodak"" boyfriend is caught on a camera phone, posted to the internet and goes viral. However this is not the success she wants but instead of being defeated she finally deals with fears, her struggles and takes a leap of faith and moves beyond all the drama and her own deadline. Isis' story and character allows us form an intimate bond with her, which makes it easy to root for our heroine early on, even if we can't identify with her race or gender. The emotional connection we have with the main character only makes the odd situations and characters she runs across that much funnier. This emotional, comedic film, full of archetypes and actors that the entire country is familiar with is sure to tug the heart strings, and tickle the funny bone of audiences worldwide.",2016,Comedy            ,"Golden Brooks, Tsai Chin, Ja'net DuBois, Eliot","Fatima Washington, Corey Johnson",14,,5.1

Now she has come up with the solution to every woman's problem, a private club called ""Whatever She Wants"" where men have to qualify to get in. No baby daddies, no bad credit, no car, no pot bellies, and no living with your mama will get you NO ENTRY. To be in the presence of these women you have to be able to give them whatever they need. It is the grand opening and Vivian is as grand as she can be. She has it all except her own man. And for her traditional and powerfully wealthy father, Theodore Wolf, this is unacceptable. In town to celebrate Vivian's fortieth birthday, Theodore discovers his financial contribution to Vivian's business ventures has turned into a social club for dating. He doesn't agree with her elitist approach to relationships. This isn't what he expected from his oldest daughter. Her time is running out and so is his patience. She has embarrassed him and the family's name and now he demands change. The only problem is... These two wolves ain't afraid to howl. Question is... Which one will be the first to bite? Meanwhile, Tracy Jamison, Vivian's more reformed younger sister and her hubby Carlos, have sought refuge in Vivian's home. Tracy and Carlos have fallen on hard times and for Vivian this is all the proof she needs as to why her ""Whatever She Wants"" social club will prevent her from struggling through a pointless marriage. She wants happiness without the fight, so she instead fights with Tracy and her husband. She ridicules Carlos for putting his dreams before his wife and convinces Tracy she doesn't have to suffer with a minimum wage brother. Enough is enough. Carlos wants to get away from it all and demands Tracy decide if she's married to him or to her sister. Not sure what to do, Tracy ventures out and finds herself in the arms of another man who promises to give her ""Whatever She Wants"". But she's not the only one making a love connection. The close hearted Vivian who has yet to find the man she wants finally meets her match. Even the men who pass her prescreening qualification detector and are allowed into her club are not into her heart. That is until Julian Heaven breaks it in. Julian is every woman's fantasy. He's stunning, sexy, charming, and legit. He catches Vivian hook, line and sinker and it doesn't take much to reel her in. But this fish might not make it to the frying pan as things start to heat up in the kitchen. It all boils over when Vivian's joy ride with Julian comes to a crashing end. Vivian's fantasy world crumbles into the harsh reality that whatever she wants just might not be what she gets.

Tiny Plastic Men,22,"Gottfried Bros Toy & Train Co. makes everything from video games to board games, from toy cars to action figures. These toys need to be tested, and those tests are carried out by the lowest rung of the company, the Prototype Department. Working in an office that looks more like a decked-out, nerdy frat house, Crad, Addison, and October test toy and game prototypes for quality, danger and defect. But most of their time is actually spent dealing with bizarre office politics, oddball guests, and their own imaginations. Sitcom adventures ensue, punctuated by off-the-wall live action and animated sketches. Team-leader Crad has some anger management issues, but he's fiercely loyal to his two buddies, and he tries hard to be a good father to his sarcastic, wiser-than-her-years daughter, Susie. Addison is the not-so-bright, but positive and fun-loving guy with a zest for life and an aversion to his ADD medication. And then there's October, a deadpan, well-educated, Edward-Scissorhands-meets-Spock, steam punk enthusiast, living in his own dark little universe. The trio are in nerd heaven, drinking and doing drugs on the job while playing with toys all day but they're easily distracted and impossible to keep on task, not to mention they are constantly thwarted by zany obstacles. Jesse, a corporate-climbing middle management game designer, thinks he's in charge of the Prototypes Department, and is always trying to steal any profitable toy and game ideas. Alexandra, the lustful man-eating boss, is more than willing to abuse her power with her underlings and routinely threatens everyone's jobs. Alexandra's father and the doddering founder, Mr. Gottfried, wanders the company's halls, often making crazy demands for toy designs which the guys must bend over backwards to accommodate. And then there are the Video Game Testers (aka ""VGT's""), the other nerdy trio and arch-rivals of the Prototypes, prank the three men and set them up for failure. Numerous guest toy designers, spokespeople, long-lost relatives and other odd folks round out the cast of characters who succeed at making life extra complicated for our heroes. The show's variety of live action and animated comedy sketches spring from the guys' daydreams, their off-color discussions, the toys and games that they test and collect, and moments in the characters' somewhat warped minds.",2012,Comedy            ,"Chris Craddock, Matt Alden, Mark Meer, Belinda Cornish",,144,,5.1
