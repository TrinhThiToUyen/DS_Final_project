2,JR0ujoXd10,Prague Food Tour - ULTIMATE CZECH FOOD + Street Food in Czech Republic!,"🎥Copenhagen Street Food Tour: https://youtu.be/gMNvp-83fDc
👕T-shirts and caps: https://migrationology.com/store/
🍌Mark Wiens Banana Chips - Worldwide Shipping Available Now: 

PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC - I was excited to visit Prague, a city I’ve been wanting to visit for many years. In this video, we’re going on an ultimate Czech food tour of Prague, and doing a full walking tour of the attractions and center of the city along the way.   

Café Savoy - For one of the most historical and beautiful restaurants and cafes in all of Prague, head to Café Savoy. It’s one of those restaurants that’s as much a museum as it is a restaurant. It’s a good place to have breakfast, or to have coffee. I had the Czech style breakfast set. Total price - 685 CZK ($29.62)

Párek v rohlíku – Ladislav Červený - If there’s one Czech street food your don’t want to miss, it’s sausages and hotdogs. And after doing some research, I discovered that not too far from where I was staying, was a popular local hotdog stall just outside the metro station. What was amazing to me is that the bun was toasted on the inside, but the outside of the bun was so soft. Great hotdogs, well worth going out of your way to eat when you’re in Prague. Price - 25 CZK ($1.08) per hotdog

Restaurace U Bansethů - My favorite type of food to eat is classic, traditional food, anywhere I travel. Restaurace U Bansethů is a restaurant with over 100 years of history, and I was very excited to go there. Menu was all in Czech, but our waiter was friendly and helpful. Something you have to note about Czech food restaurants (at least in my experience so far) is that they often have dishes of the day, and don’t have the full menu. So it’s best to choose the dishes of the day. I ordered their signature stuffed duck, a plate of tongue and dumplings, and we also tried a beef stew, which was similar to goulash, but had a different name. Food was delicious, and especially paired with Czech beer. 477 CZK ($20.62) - Total price for everything

Lahůdky Zlatý kříž - Next up on this ultimate Prague food tour, we headed back to the center of Prague and I ordered a few Czech open faced sandwiches from Lahůdky Zlatý kříž. Great local place to get food on the go. 77 CZK ($3.33)

Zahradní restaurace Letenský zámeček - Next, we headed on a little walk across the river and up the hill to a beer garden and terrance overlooking old town of Prague. I would highly recommend visiting, the ambiance was fantastic, and the views were spectacular.

Lokál - Beer Restaurant - Finally, when I reached out to you on social media about where to eat in Prague, one of the top suggestions was Lokál, a place loved by all for their great Czech beer, and for their food. We had a great experience, and it’s the type of place that would be fun to go with many friends. 726 CZK ($31.39)

Thank you for watching this ultimate Czech food tour of Prague, Czech Republic!

11,kvLv0Ne7-aU,japanese street food - okonomiyaki,"Okonomiyaki  o-konomi-yaki is a Japanese savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients. The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning ""how you like"" or ""what you like"", and yaki meaning ""grill"". Okonomiyaki is mainly associated with the Kansai or Hiroshima areas of Japan, but is widely available throughout the country. Toppings and batters tend to vary according to region. In Tokyo, there is a semi-liquid okonomiyaki called 'monjayaki.'
Kansai- or Osaka-style okonomiyaki is the predominant version of the dish, found throughout most of Japan. The batter is made of flour, grated nagaimo (a type of yam), water or dashi, eggs and shredded cabbage, and usually contains other ingredients such as green onion, meat (generally thin pork belly, often mistaken for bacon), octopus, squid, shrimp, vegetables, konjac, mochi or cheese. Okonomiyaki is sometimes compared to an omelette or a pancake and may be referred to as a ""Japanese pizza"" or ""Osaka soul food""
Some okonomiyaki restaurants are grill-it-yourself establishments, where the server produces a bowl of raw ingredients that the customer mixes and grills at tables fitted with teppan, or special hotplates. They may also have a diner-style counter where the cook prepares the dish in front of the customers.
In Osaka (the largest city in the Kansai region), where this dish is said to have originated, okonomiyaki is prepared much like a pancake. The batter and other ingredients are pan-fried on both sides on either a teppan or a pan using metal spatulas that are later used to slice the dish when it has finished cooking. Cooked okonomiyaki is topped with ingredients that include otafuku/okonomiyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce but thicker and sweeter), aonori (seaweed flakes), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger (beni shoga).",food

T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you’ll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It’s a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I’m a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Again, thank you to Oh My Media Malaysia for taking us around:

Chinese Street Food Shanghai - Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
Chinese street food and Chinese Food in China is incredibly delicious! So I flew to Shanghai, China and have been eating street food, noodles, and dumplings non-stop. Best Street Food to try! The Chinese food is so good in Shanghai! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Chengdu, street food in Xi’an, street food in Guangzhou, and now, street food in Shanghai. A lot of the street food in Shanghai is similar to other street food in China. You can find some unique Shanghai street food specialties here, like xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), shengjianbao (pan fried dumplings), seafood on the street, and some delicious noodles as well. You can also enjoy countless other street foods in Shanghai, many featured in this video.

►Subscribe - http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts - https://migrationology.com/store/

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you’ll find in this video:

Zürich, Switzerland

Café Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I’ve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossmünster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn’t realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Zürcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It’s quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don’t want  to miss when you’re in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

32,UvDGBIkJaqQ,,"One of the best Chinese street foods you will ever eat in China is the Dan Dan Noodles! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! Spicy Chinese Dan Dan noodles are the best street food in China! If you love spicy Sichuan food and street food in China, then you're going to love Dan Dan noodles, because they are so flavorful and covered in a rich chili oil!

► The BEST VPNs for China:


In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles. 

► MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): 

►BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): 


► MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: 

China has so many amazing street foods to try, and I've been filming and documenting them for you for the past 4 years. In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!

If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. 

When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. 

When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!
